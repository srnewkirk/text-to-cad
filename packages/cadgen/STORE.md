# The store

`~/.cache/cadgen/` — where every model's result lives. Read this before
changing anything under `cadgen/store/`, the build pipeline that writes to it,
or a consumer that reads from it. It is written so that someone who only ran
`pip install cadgen` can act on every sentence.

## 1. Vocabulary

One word per concept; the code uses these words and no others.

| term | meaning |
|---|---|
| **model** | a parameterless decorated function — `@step` (with any stacked `@stl/@glb/@threemf`), `@stl/@glb/@threemf` alone (mesh-only), or `@dxf` (a drawing); identity = its resolved script path plus the function's name, spelled `script.py::function`; a file usually holds one (then the bare path names it and its default output is `<file>.<fmt>`) and may hold several (each writing `<function>.<fmt>`), which share the file's closure; its outputs are what its decorators declare |
| **parent / child** | models related by a call inside a body |
| **build** | running a model's function and publishing its result |
| **store** | the whole cache, `~/.cache/cadgen/`: `objects/` + `index/` |
| **object** | an immutable, content-addressed file in `objects/` — a component or a tree |
| **component** | a leaf geometry object: one solid's `.brep` + `.surf` |
| **tree** | a model's result object: its own components + links, with placements, names, colors; its hash is the model's result identity |
| **link** | a tree entry pointing at a child's tree hash, with placement and name |
| **pin** | the child tree hash a parent resolved during a build (noun and verb) |
| **record** | the mutable per-model entry in `index/`: current tree hash, closure, children pins, outputs |
| **index** | the input-addressed side of the store: records, op-memo entries, mesh entries |
| **op memo** | the per-kernel-operation cache (always two words) |
| **closure** | the source files a model's build read |
| **stale / current**, **gate** | the freshness state and the check that decides it |
| **worker / spare / extra**, **job** | daemon vocabulary (the daemon's own documentation) |

Retired words: node, package, descriptor, manifest, ref (as a store concept),
memo (bare), scope, blob. They do not appear in code or documentation.

## 2. Layout

```
~/.cache/cadgen/                      (CADGEN_CACHE_DIR overrides; else the platform cache dir)
  objects/ab/cdef…                    immutable, content-addressed, sharded like git
  index/document/<sha256(file bytes)> ARTIFACT side: {tree, kind, meshes} for a file's bytes
  index/model/<sha256(script::function)>  records (input-addressed, mutable, atomic)
  index/output/<sha256(output path)>  {model}: which script wrote the file at this path
  index/component/<cid>               component entries → {surf, brep} object hashes
  index/op/<sha256(op key)>           op-memo entries → object hash
  index/mesh/<key>                    tessellation entries → object hash
```

Nothing else lives under the root. A build's progress is process state, not
content: the daemon's job ledger, read over its socket (§7, §9).

### The two sides of the store — a law

`objects/` is the **artifact side**: what geometry exists. `index/model`,
`index/output`, `index/op`, `index/mesh`, `index/component` are the **code
side**: what source produced it, what it depended on, what may be reused.
`index/document` is the one artifact-side index: `sha256(file bytes)` → the
tree describing those bytes (plus a mesh ledger keyed by format × tolerances
× pose — the bare mesh doors read and write it, and a script run notes its
declared meshes there too, so the two front doors never redo each other's work). Three properties, each enforced by a
test:

1. **No object references source.** No tree or component carries a path, a
   script name, a closure or source hash, or a record key. The same bytes
   anywhere on disk are the same tree.
2. **A reader never consults a record.** A door (`inspect`, `snapshot`,
   `stl|3mf|glb build`, `step build` on a document), the viewer's catalog and
   render, and the mesh ledger find a tree in ONE lookup — hash the file's
   bytes, read `index/document`, read objects — and never open `index/model`
   or `index/output`. A miss is a compile job, never a refusal. The viewer
   reads no record at all — no exception: its status is artifact-side (not
   compiled / compiling / rendered / failed) and it never learns which model
   wrote a document. "Is this document behind its source" is `cadgen store
   why`'s and the build tree's question.
3. **Records are deletable.** `rm -rf index/model index/output` loses no
   artifact: every reader still works from objects; a rebuild re-creates the
   records without rebuilding a tree whose objects exist.

`index/document` is written whenever a tree is published for a document — by
a model's build for its `.step`, by a compile job for the file it compiled.
`index/output` is written beside it for `store why` and provenance;
nothing in the viewer or on a render path reads it.

There are exactly two ways a file is named, and that is the only distinction
the store makes:

- **Content-addressed** (`objects/`): the name is `sha256(bytes)`. Two kinds
  of object exist — a **component** (the `.brep` bytes, and separately the
  `.surf` bytes, of one solid) and a **tree** (JSON). Writing an object is
  idempotent; an object is never rewritten or edited. A result is complete
  when its tree object exists, and nothing references a tree until it does,
  so a half-written result cannot exist.
- **Input-addressed** (`index/`): the name is derived from what PRODUCED the
  entry (a script path, a kernel operation's inputs, a surface × tolerance),
  and the entry is a small JSON file pointing at objects or recording facts.
  Entries are mutable and written temp + rename.

No directories per result, no hardlinks, no staging directories, no version
salts. The `.step` document, its sidecar and declared mesh files are
**outputs** in the project, not store contents; the record lists them with shas.

## 3. Tree and record

### Tree

A tree is the JSON a model's build writes. Its hash is the model's result
identity. A real one (`link_arm`: a bar plus two placements of a pin model):

```json
{
  "label": "link_arm",
  "entryKind": "assembly",
  "units": "mm",
  "components": {
    "0c5932ad05ce64a6": {"surf": "c1a8623b…", "brep": "ebe7552f…", "contentHash": "0c5932ad…"}
  },
  "occurrences": [
    {"id": "o1.1", "name": "bar", "component": "0c5932ad05ce64a6", "transform": [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1]}
  ],
  "links": [
    {"id": "o1.2", "name": "pin_left",  "tree": "265aee57…", "transform": [1,0,0,-15, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,2, 0,0,0,1]},
    {"id": "o1.3", "name": "pin_right", "tree": "265aee57…", "transform": [1,0,0,15,  0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,2, 0,0,0,1]}
  ],
  "assembly": {"root": {"id": "o1", "name": "link_arm", "nodeType": "assembly", "children": [
    {"id": "o1.1", "name": "bar", "nodeType": "part", "leafPartIds": ["o1.1"], "children": []},
    {"id": "o1.2", "name": "pin_left", "nodeType": "link", "tree": "265aee57…", "children": []},
    {"id": "o1.3", "name": "pin_right", "nodeType": "link", "tree": "265aee57…", "children": []}
  ]}},
  "bbox": {"min": [-20, -4, 0], "max": [20, 4, 14]},
  "stats": {"occurrenceCount": 1, "linkCount": 2}
}
```

- `components` are geometry this model created itself, keyed by component id
  (`cid`, a content hash of the exact shape); each names the `.surf` and
  `.brep` objects. `occurrences` place components; `links` place children's
  trees. Two placements of one child are two links to one tree. Transforms
  are 16 numbers, row-major, translation in the fourth column, in the
  parent's frame.
- `assembly.root` is the grouping the author's compound expressed; a link
  appears in it as a node of type `link`.
- Consumers that speak the older flat shape (the viewer client, the Node
  exporters) read a **flattened** tree: `cadgen.store.trees.flatten` expands
  links recursively (ids rebased — a child's `o1.2` under link `o1.3` becomes
  `o1.3.2`; a part child's single occurrence takes the link's name),
  composes transforms, and merges components. `cadgen.store.view` lays that
  out as a temporary directory or serves it virtually; nothing of the sort is
  ever written INTO the store.

### Record

The mutable per-model entry, `index/model/<sha256(model ref)>` where the model
ref is `<resolved script path>::<function name>` — the script and the decorated
function, because a file may hold several models (each its own record, output
and job). An imported document's record is keyed on its own path (no function).
A real one (`link_robot`: a base, two placements of `link_arm`, one of
`link_pin`):

```json
{
  "kind": "record",
  "model": "/abs/models/assemblies/src/link_robot/link_robot.py::link_robot",
  "script": "/abs/models/assemblies/src/link_robot/link_robot.py",
  "function": "link_robot",
  "entryKind": "assembly",
  "sourceKind": "python",
  "tree": "64429167…",
  "closure": {"hash": "e341ac84…", "files": ["/abs/models/assemblies/src/link_robot/link_robot.py"], "static": false},
  "children": [
    {"model": "/abs/models/assemblies/src/link_robot/link_arm.py::link_arm", "tree": "c161092b…"},
    {"model": "/abs/models/assemblies/src/link_robot/link_pin.py::link_pin", "tree": "265aee57…"}
  ],
  "outputs": {"/abs/models/assemblies/STEP/link_robot/link_robot.step": {"sha256": "823699b0…"}},
  "stepHash": "823699b0…"
}
```

- `children` is recorded from the CALLS the body made — every child wrapper
  entered during the body appends `(model, pinned tree)`, whether that child
  ended up linked, inlined, modified or discarded. It is never derived from
  links.
- `closure.files` is the model's static import closure (AST, transitive,
  first-party, absolute and relative imports alike — a `lib/` package's
  `from .chain import X` counts) **stopping at model files**, plus files executed in its own
  frame and discovered inputs (`read_step` documents). The render module
  beside a document (`<name>.step.js`, choreography) is not an input: no build
  reads it, so editing it never makes a model stale. The
  boundary is decided statically by what the importer TAKES from a model
  file: only model functions (`from arm import arm`) → a result edge, file
  excluded, the child tracked by its pin; a module-level literal (`from plate
  import WIDTH` where `WIDTH = 40.0` — numbers, str, bool, None, tuples/
  lists/dicts of those) → a value edge, file excluded, the value tracked in
  `constants`; anything else (a helper function, a `bd.` object, an
  expression) → a source edge, file included. **Constants by value,
  functions by file, models by result.** Hit and miss runs record identical
  closures by construction. `closure.static: true` marks a record whose
  inputs are not files (a document re-emitted by `cadgen step build`); the
  gate's clause 2 does not re-hash files for it.
- `constants` is `{"<model file, relative to the script>": {"<NAME>":
  "<sha256 of the literal's canonical repr>"}}` — every literal the model
  took from a model file by value. Empty for most models. The gate's clause
  2 re-hashes each value by importing the model file under a **kernel-guarded
  loader** (`cadgen.store.closure.module_constant_hashes`: the script's folder
  and the caller's `PYTHONPATH` on `sys.path`, a private module name, the bytes on disk compiled
  fresh) — a model file whose import pulls the kernel, or fails, reads as
  stale rather than as unchanged. This is why a model file's top level must
  stay kernel-free (`from cadgen import build123d as bd`, no `bd.` in module
  constants): the gate runs it.
- A leaf has `children: []`. Roots and leaves have the same record. A record
  for an imported document (`sourceKind: "step"`) has the document's bytes as
  its closure.
- A **drawing** (`@dxf`) is a model like any other: the same wrapper, record,
  gate and job. `entryKind: "drawing"`, `tree: null` (gate clause 4 is
  vacuous), its `.dxf` as the one output, and `children` pinned from the
  models its body called — a flat pattern of `bracket()` goes stale when
  bracket's geometry changes. The viewer and `dxf snapshot` read the `.dxf`
  file directly; there is no drawing-specific freshness anywhere.
- A model's **outputs are whatever its decorators declare**. STEP is one
  output kind, not the primary: a model declared by `@stl`/`@glb`/`@threemf`
  alone has the same tree and record as any model, every stale declared mesh
  is (re)generated from that tree, and no `.step` (and no sidecar) is written
  — `outputs` simply lists no document and `stepHash` is empty.
- `outputs` may carry per-output facts a door needs (`declared`, the
  tessellation `chord`/`angle`); those are the door's, the store only keeps
  them beside the sha.

## 4. The gate

`cadgen.store.gate.stale(model)` — one function for every model. Stale if any
of:

1. **No record.** Protects against reading a result that was never built or
   whose record was collected.
2. **`sha256(closure.files as they are now) != closure.hash`, or a constant
   in `constants` no longer hashes to its recorded value.** Protects against
   a source edit; the hash is a semantic hash of each file's Python
   (comments and formatting do not count), computed at execution time (§5).
   A literal imported from a model file is compared as a value: a comment,
   a body edit or a new helper in that file leaves the importer current; a
   changed value (or the name no longer bound to a literal) makes it stale.
3. **Any recorded child is stale, or its current tree hash differs from the
   pinned hash.** Protects against a child whose RESULT changed — and lets a
   child edit that yields identical geometry leave the parent current.
   Recursion is memoized per request.
4. **The tree object, or any component it (transitively) references, is
   missing.** Protects against a collected or half-copied store.
5. **A declared output does not match `outputs`.** Protects against a deleted,
   hand-edited or foreign `.step`/sidecar/mesh file beside the model.

Mesh tolerances and argv flags are not inputs. Imported STEPs are inputs (a
`read_step` file is in the closure), not models. `--force` rebuilds the named
model only; its children go through the gate as usual. `cadgen store forget
<model.py>` drops the record instead, so the next run — not this one — rebuilds
it (§10, Resets).

## 5. Invariants

Each with the failure it prevents.

- **Hash at execution.** A closure file is hashed when the interpreter
  executes it (an audit hook on `exec`), not after the build. Prevents: a file
  edited during a long build being recorded with the bytes that did NOT run,
  which would make a stale result read as current forever.
- **Publish order.** Objects first (components, then the tree), then the
  outputs (`.step` moved into place atomically; sidecar), then the record.
  Prevents: a record pointing at a tree that does not exist yet, or a `.step`
  whose sha the record has not seen.
- **Publish rule.** `cadgen.store.publish.decide`: a build never replaces a
  current record with a stale one — if the record on disk already reflects the
  closure as it is NOW and the build that finished ran against older sources,
  the result is discarded. Prevents: two concurrent builds of one model ending
  with the older source's result on disk.
- **Children from calls, never from links.** Prevents: a modified or discarded
  child dropping out of the dependency edge, so an edit to it would not reach
  the parent.
- **Closure boundary rule.** A model file reached only through its model
  function is a result edge (pin); a module-level literal taken from it is a
  value edge (`constants`); anything else taken from it is a source edge
  (file in the closure). Constants by value, functions by file, models by
  result. Prevents both false-current (a constant imported from a model file
  changing unnoticed) and false-stale (a child's internal edit — or a comment
  beside a shared constant — rebuilding every parent).
- **The two sides (§2, the law).** No object references source; no reader
  consults a record; records are deletable. Prevents: a moved or copied
  document rendering differently from its twin, a render path going stale or
  refusing because of a record's state, and a store-side cleanup destroying
  anything a user can see.
- **Pins and snapshot isolation.** A parent materializes the tree it pinned
  when the child was resolved, even if the child is rebuilt mid-parent-build.
  Prevents: a parent's result mixing two versions of one child.
- **Objects are immutable.** An object is written once under its hash and
  never edited. Prevents: a component changing under every tree that shares
  it.
- **Portability: a moved project is a set of new models over the same
  objects.** Nothing path-dependent enters an object: closure files are
  recorded relative to the script, trees hold geometry, names and placements
  only, and component ids are content hashes — so a moved or copied project
  hashes to the same closures and the same trees. Records ARE keyed by the
  resolved script path (and function), so after a move every model reads as unbuilt (clause
  1); its first build runs the body once, finds every component and tree
  already present (nothing is re-extracted or rewritten; the tree hash comes
  out identical), writes a new record and re-notes its outputs in
  `index/output`. The moved documents themselves never stopped rendering:
  `index/document` is keyed by their bytes, so every door and the viewer
  find the same tree at the new path before any rebuild; only `store why`
  reads the moved model as unbuilt until then. The
  records at the old path become unreachable and GC collects them. Prevents:
  two projects at different paths sharing one record and one overwriting the
  other's outputs list; and a path or timestamp changing a hash.
- **Outputs are not store contents.** The `.step`, sidecar and meshes live in
  the project; the record validates them by sha (clause 5). Prevents: a
  store wipe destroying a user's documents, and a document pretending to be
  current after a hand edit.
- **No locks are needed for correctness.** Objects are idempotent, entries
  are temp+rename, the publish rule decides concurrent same-model outcomes,
  pins isolate parents. There is no lock layer (§7); two builders of one
  model may do the same kernel work twice, and the publish rule keeps one.

## 6. Link or component

Decided mechanically; there is no error path.

- `cadgen.store.materialize.materialize(tree)` rebuilds a child's geometry as
  a build123d `Compound` and TAGS it with the tree hash and a handle to the
  shape it was built from. The tag is metadata for the build, not part of any
  contract a model author sees.
- When the parent's result is written, every tagged compound found in it whose
  shape is still the one it was materialized with (`IsPartner`: same
  underlying shape, any rigid placement, relabelled or recolored or not)
  becomes a **link**. Everything else — geometry the parent made, a sub-shape
  it extracted, a child it modified (`housing() - holes`), a mirrored child —
  becomes the parent's own **components**. Modifying a child is legitimate and
  fully tracked (the child is still in `children` because it was called); it
  simply makes the parent own that geometry instead of linking.
- Placement that keeps the link: `child.moved(loc)` and `Location * child`
  (the same shape, re-placed). build123d's `child.located(loc)` deep-copies
  the geometry (`BRepBuilderAPI_Copy`), which serializes to different bytes —
  a new component id, so a component rather than a link. That is not new
  cost (the copy never shared a component id either); it is why the skill
  places with `moved()`.
- **The materialize contract.** A parent may rely on: the child's exact
  geometry, its labels, colors and placements, as a compound whose children
  mirror the child's grouping. It receives nothing else — a child's sidecar
  content (kinematics, animation, export declarations) never rides up.
- A `link` in a tree is resolved by hash, so two placements of one child are
  two links to one object, and a child shared by many parents is stored once.

## 7. Concurrency

No serialization, no cancellation, no waiting on another build.

- **Same model twice.** Both builds run. Each publishes objects (idempotent)
  and then consults the publish rule: the one whose closure matches the
  sources as they are now wins the record; the other's result is left as
  unreferenced objects for GC.
- **Edit a child while its parent builds.** The parent already pinned the
  child's tree when it called it; it materializes that pin and publishes a
  record whose pin no longer matches the child's current tree. The parent is
  therefore already stale when it finishes — the next gate says so (clause
  3) and the next run rebuilds it. `cadgen store why` shows the mismatch.
- **Edit a parent while a child builds.** Unrelated: the child's record and
  tree are its own. The parent's next build calls the child, finds it
  current, and pins the new tree.
- **The only wait** is a parent forcing a child it submitted itself (§Lazy
  children); it never waits for a build it did not start.
- **No locks.** There is no lock layer: every store write is atomic
  (temp + rename) and idempotent, the document is written to a temp file and
  moved into place, the record cross-validates the outputs by sha (gate
  clause 5), and the publish rule decides same-model outcomes. Progress is
  not on disk at all: the daemon keeps a ledger of every job it runs (state,
  phase n/total, the job's declared output paths) and serves it with `daemon
  status`; the CAD Viewer matches jobs to the documents it shows by output
  path — a CLI build, a parent's child build and its own compile read alike —
  and nothing reads any of it to decide freshness. With `CADGEN_DAEMON=0`
  there is no ledger, and concurrent builds are unbrokered
  — safe by the two invariants above, wasteful, and a debugging mode.

## 8. GC

`cadgen store gc [--dry-run] [--grace-hours H]` — mark and sweep. Reachable =
every object referenced (transitively, through links) from a record, plus the
objects component/op/mesh entries point at, plus anything modified within the
grace period (default 1 h — the window in which a build may still hold a pin
to a child's previous tree). No age sweeps, no per-tier rules. GC does not
consult the daemon: the grace period is the whole protection for a build in
flight, so do not sweep with `--grace-hours 0` while anything is building.
Nothing runs GC automatically.

## 9. The daemon

Every build goes through one interface, `cadgen.daemon.executors.submit(model)
-> job`, with two executors that behave identically:

- **Daemon executor (default).** Workers are persistent and warm. The routing
  key is the model (`script::function` — two models in one file are two
  subjects, two workers): a request for a model whose worker is
  idle takes it; whose worker is busy binds a spare as an **extra** for that
  one job (the extra returns to the spare set after); a model with no worker
  binds a spare and a replacement starts in the background; no spare means a
  spawn. Spares: `CADGEN_DAEMON_SPARES` (default 2). Requests that name no
  model (`inspect`, `snapshot` on a document) borrow a spare without binding
  it. Nothing waits on another build, nothing is capped, nothing counts
  memory, no bound worker is idle-reaped; a worker is recycled after
  `CADGEN_DAEMON_RECYCLE` jobs (default 1000) as a leak hedge, and the daemon
  exits after `CADGEN_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT` seconds idle (default 3600).
  Inside a worker, `submit` is the same client call back to the daemon, so a
  parent's children land on their own workers while the parent's body runs.
- **Transient executor (`CADGEN_DAEMON=0`).** A subprocess per job, alive for
  this build only. Each imports build123d once, concurrently with its
  siblings. It inherits the environment, so a test's `CADGEN_CACHE_DIR`
  isolates its store; tests and CI run this way.

**One daemon per address, by lock.** The daemon takes a process-lifetime
exclusive lock keyed by its socket address (`cadgen.daemon.transport.
SingletonLock`: `flock` on POSIX, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows, released by the
kernel when the holder dies) before it binds — a private socket is a private
daemon; a second daemon starting for the same address stands down at
once, touching nothing; the winner is by construction alone, so a socket file it
finds is dead and may be removed. Clients elect one spawner the same way and
the rest wait for the address; the authkey is created once via a linked temp
file. This is the one lock cadgen keeps — a singleton for the daemon, never a
build lock (§7): twenty clients starting at once used to start twenty daemons
that unlinked each other's live sockets.

The **store root is a field on every request** (`store_root`), applied per
job in the worker, never inherited from whichever build spawned the daemon:
one daemon serves any number of isolated stores. The daemon holds no store
state of its own. `cadgen daemon status` reports each worker's `model`,
`busy`, `jobs`, `extra`, plus `spares`, `imports` (cold spawns),
`concurrent` (extras bound) and `jobs running n/N, queued m, coalesced k`;
`--json` adds the **job ledger** (`cadgen.daemon.jobs`): every job the
daemon ran in the last 120 s with its state (`submitted` → `queued` →
`building` [phase, done/total] → `done` | `failed`) and the output paths it
declared, parsed statically from the script it names. The ledger is the CAD
Viewer's only progress source, and it is process state, never a file.

The CLI doors (`cadgen step inspect|snapshot|build`, `stl|3mf|glb build`)
are themselves dispatched through the daemon when one is reachable, so they
run on warm kernels; the subject-less commands (`store`, `doctor`, `daemon
status`, the mesh and drawing snapshots) run in-process and never touch it.

Three static mechanisms bound the pool — none adaptive, none heuristic, no
memory is ever measured (`cadgen.daemon.broker`):

1. **Job slots — one running build per core.** A FIFO counting semaphore of
   `N = os.cpu_count()` slots per executor (`CADGEN_JOBS` overrides; daemon-wide
   for the daemon executor, per top-level build for the transient one, whose
   root process runs a private broker its workers inherit). A job takes a slot
   before its body runs and holds it through its emit; it **yields the slot
   while it waits for a child it forced** and reacquires — queuing if it must —
   when the child is done. A waiting parent therefore holds nothing, which is
   why a 1-slot pool still builds a 3-level tree. Slots count kernel work only:
   the build pipeline takes one around a model body and its emit. **Doors take
   none and never run a body**: `inspect`, `snapshot` and the mesh doors
   (`stl|3mf|glb build`) ask one question of a document — does the store have a
   tree for this file's bytes (`doors.document_tree`: `sha256(bytes)` →
   `index/document` → tree; no record is opened, §2 the law)? Yes → read it; a
   source that has moved on is the model's record's business, not the door's,
   so no document is ever refused. No → the door (or the CAD Viewer) submits a
   **compile job** to the pool (`executors.submit_compile`) that builds a tree
   from the bytes, generated or imported alike — the one door operation that is
   a job: it runs on a spare, holds a slot through its read and emit, coalesces
   on the document's bytes and shows in the tree. The tree shows `queued` when a
   slot did not come at once.
2. **In-flight coalescing.** A child submit carries its source's closure hash;
   a submit for `(model, closure)` matching a job already in flight attaches to
   that job instead of starting another. In flight only, identical source only,
   never a lookup into the past — and never the model a top-level request named
   (a second `python a.py` still runs, on an extra). Two parents needing one
   stale child build it once.
3. **Idle unbind — 10 minutes** (`CADGEN_DAEMON_IDLE_UNBIND`). A bound worker
   idle that long returns to the spare set (spares beyond K exit); its model's
   next build rebinds a spare — no import repaid — with a cold RAM op-memo tier.
   Purely RAM: idle workers hold no slot and never block a new model.

## 9a. Lazy children

Inside a body, a child call returns at once with a `LazyCompound`
(`cadgen.store.lazy`) — a `build123d.Compound` whose `.wrapped` is a property.
The gate runs at the call: a stale child is submitted to the pool and the
promise carries the job; a current child is a promise with no job. Geometry
arrives on the first read of `.wrapped` — normally at the closing
`Compound(children=[...])`, after every sibling has been submitted — so
siblings build in parallel and the parent waits only for children it
submitted itself. Deferred without forcing: `Pos/Rot/Location * child`,
`.moved()`, `.label =`, `.color =`. Everything else (`.faces()`,
`.bounding_box()`, booleans, `copy.copy`, `Compound(children=...)`) forces:
a body that reads a child before placing the next forces it there, and
parallelism follows the dependencies the author wrote. Forcing waits for the
job, materializes the pinned tree (§6), applies the deferred placement, label
and color, and tags the result exactly as an eager materialize would, so the
link/component decision is unchanged. **Pins are taken at the call**: a
current child's record is read when the parent calls it and its tree is pinned
then, so a rebuild of that child between the call and the force cannot change
what this build composes; a stale child's pin is its job's result, fixed when
the job was submitted. The same stale child called twice shares one job. A failed child raises `ChildBuildError` at the forcing site,
naming the call site in the parent and carrying the worker's output.

The top-level call renders the graph these calls reveal as a build tree on
stderr (`cadgen.cli_tree`): a TTY gets one refreshed block — `submitted`,
`building · <phase> n/total`, `current`, `✓ <time>`, finished subtrees folded
to one line, current children counted on the parent's line; `--json` or a
non-TTY gets one JSON line per model transition. Child events reach the root
through the pool, tagged with the root request's id, identically for both
executors. After publishing, the root runs its gate once more and says
`already stale: …; rerun` if a child changed during the build.

## 10. Debugging

- Which record: `index/model/<sha256(script::function)>` —
  `cadgen store why <model.py>` prints it (every model of the file; name one
  as `model.py::function`), the gate's verdict clause by
  clause (with each child's pinned vs current tree), the closure files and
  the tree's links. The verdict line names the first stale clause as a
  phrase: `no record`, `closure changed: <file>` (the record keeps each
  closure file's hash under `closure.shas`), `constant changed: <NAME> in
  <file>`, `child stale: <child.py>`, `child result moved: <child.py>`,
  `tree or components missing`, `never written: <path>`, `output missing:
  <path>`, `output changed: <path>`.
- Resolve a tree: `cadgen.store.trees.get_tree(hash)`; flattened with
  `flatten(hash)`. Components: `tree["components"]`, each with its `surf` and
  `brep` object hashes under `objects/ab/cdef…`.
- `cadgen store info` sizes the store. `cadgen store gc --dry-run` lists what
  a sweep would remove.
- **Resets, smallest first.** `python model.py --force` rebuilds one model
  now. `cadgen store forget <model.py>` drops that model's record (the next
  run rebuilds it; children untouched, parents see the moved pin then);
  `cadgen store forget <document>` drops the `index/document` entry for the
  file's bytes and the record that wrote it, so the next open or door call
  compiles it again. `forget` never deletes objects — `cadgen store gc` does,
  for whatever no record reaches any more. Clearing the store is always safe:
  delete `~/.cache/cadgen` (or the `CADGEN_CACHE_DIR` directory); every model
  reads as stale and rebuilds; no project file is touched.
- The gate has no cadgen-version clause: a record built by a cadgen with a
  bug stays current after the fix, and so does every parent tree that linked
  what it built. Recover with `forget` on the affected models (or the parents
  that link them), or clear the store.

## 11. Never

- Write a file into the store non-atomically (objects: temp + rename under
  the hash; entries: temp + rename).
- Put a path, a timestamp, or anything machine-specific into an object.
- Derive a model's dependencies from its tree's links.
- Add a version salt to a store name.
- Add a lock that a reader consults to decide freshness — or any build lock
  at all; the publish rule and pins are the whole concurrency story.
- Let a door, the viewer, snapshot or any render path open `index/model` or
  `index/output` (§2, property 2). A reader's one lookup is `sha256(bytes)` →
  `index/document` → objects.
- Make a reader refuse, or a door rebuild from source: a missing tree is a
  compile job from the file's bytes; "behind its script" is `store why`'s.
- Add a memory cap, a worker cap, or an age-based eviction rule.
- Let a decorator argument change the geometry a model produces: arguments
  place files, tune how they are written, and declare kinematics; the tree
  is the return value as returned (README law 16).
- Write a sidecar for anything but kinematics, or copy into it what only a
  record needs (README law 17): a mesh door tessellates the document's tree
  and never reads a declaration back.
- Use a retired word (§1) in code or documentation.
