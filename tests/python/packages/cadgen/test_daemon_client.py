"""What the client says when the warm worker running its job dies.

The defect this pins: a 2,700-occurrence validate ran 35 minutes on a warm worker,
the worker was killed (out of memory, most likely), and the caller saw one line --
``cadgen-daemon: worker closed the connection`` -- and exit 1. Nothing said the
worker had died, nothing named the job, nothing said how to run it where the failure
could be seen. The fix is the MESSAGE, deliberately not a silent cold retry: a
half-hour job re-running unannounced is worse than the failure it hides.

Driven through ``_run_request`` with a scripted channel, so the wording is pinned at
the one place it is composed and no daemon has to be started.
