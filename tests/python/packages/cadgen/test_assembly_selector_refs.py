"""An assembly's refs must resolve in the namespace the tools actually hand out.

Issue 0b (tom-cad FEEDBACK.md): `snapshot --mode list` and the CAD Viewer enumerate instance-tree
occurrences -- `#o1.12 shoulder_yaw_yoke` -- while `inspect refs` and `snapshot --focus/--hide`
resolved against the whole-assembly topology sidecar, which is extracted from the COMPOSED
compound and therefore describes any assembly as ONE occurrence. Every ref a user could pick was
rejected by every tool that could measure it, and `--facts` reported `occurrenceCount: 1` for a
160-part assembly.

These cover the merge itself (real package, real descriptor) and the transform arithmetic, which
is the part with a wrong answer that looks plausible.
