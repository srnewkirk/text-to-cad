"""A published skill must not run against a cadgen it was not published against.

`scripts/release/pin-cadgen-requirements.sh` writes `cadgen==<release>` into every
skill's requirements.txt at publish, but nothing makes pip re-resolve that on a machine
where some other cadgen is already installed. The skill then runs on an untested runtime
and fails somewhere far from the cause. `enforce_requirements_pin` is the entrypoint
check that turns it into one line naming both versions.

Its silence matters as much as its failure: a development checkout is deliberately
unpinned (`cadgen[snapshot]`) so the editable install satisfies it, and the guard runs on
EVERY skill invocation. A false positive there would break the repo's own workflows.

The companion policy test that keeps the guard wired into the shims is
tests/python/global/test_shim_pin_guard.py.
