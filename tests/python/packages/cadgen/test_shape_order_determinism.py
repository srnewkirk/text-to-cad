"""build123d de-duplicates shapes through ``set()``, which orders by heap address.

``Shape.__hash__`` is ``hash(self.wrapped)`` and OCCT hashes a ``TopoDS_Shape``
from its ``TShape`` pointer, so every ``set()`` of shapes iterates in allocation
order. Where that order reaches geometry — ``Edge.make_line(*two_vertices)``
picks a direction from a two-element set, an intersection chain re-seeds from a
deduplicated list — identical source produces byte-different BREP, and cadgen's
component ids ARE hashes of that BREP. The component cache then misses on every
build for reasons that have nothing to do with the model.

``cadgen._internal.determinism`` keeps the de-duplication and drops only the
address-derived order. These tests pin both halves of it.
