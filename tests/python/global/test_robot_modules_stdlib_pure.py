"""The URDF/SRDF/SDF VALIDATION family in cadgen must stay stdlib-pure.

These modules are deliberately extraction-ready: robot-description validation is a
text/XML problem, not a CAD-kernel problem, and keeping the family free of
OCP/build123d/numpy is what preserves the option of breaking it back out of cadgen
(or running it in an environment without the heavy dependency set). A heavy import
added in passing would silently destroy that property — every suite would still
pass, because the test environment has the kernel installed.

Static check over the AST (not an import-time sys.modules probe) so an offending
import is caught even when it is lazy, conditional, or function-local.

`snapshot` is the one verb outside that promise, and deliberately: rendering a robot
means a headless browser, so `urdf.snapshot()` cannot be extraction-ready and there
is nothing to gain from pretending. What it MUST stay is import-cheap — the
namespace binds a door object built by a stdlib-only factory, and the renderer is
reached only when the verb is called. `ImportCost` below pins that half, which is
what the static scan can no longer see.
