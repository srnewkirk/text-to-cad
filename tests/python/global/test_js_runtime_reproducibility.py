"""The JS side must build and test the same way on every machine and every Node.

Two independent ways that stopped being true, both reported in #201:

* the Viewer bundler picked its package manager from what was INSTALLED, so a release
  built on a laptop with pnpm on PATH was bundled against a different node_modules layout
  than the committed lockfile describes;
* the JS test runners passed ``--experimental-default-type=module``, a flag that current
  Node rejects outright -- so the suites refused to start rather than failing a test.

Both are the kind of thing nobody notices until a specific machine or a specific Node,
which is why they are pinned here rather than left to whoever runs the build next.
