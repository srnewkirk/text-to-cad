"""Every `python -m`-invokable cadgen CLI module must actually run when invoked.

A module that defines a top-level ``main()`` but has no ``__main__`` guard
exits 0 silently under ``python -m`` — the caller gets a success code and no
work (this shipped once: ``cadgen.cli.step_snapshot`` was documented as a
module entrypoint and did nothing). The guard is one line and easy to forget,
so it is policy-checked here rather than re-reviewed each time.

The second check below is the same idea one level up: every command in the
dispatch registry must ANSWER ``--help``.
