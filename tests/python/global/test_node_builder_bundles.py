"""cadgen must ship the Node builders its own producers spawn.

cadgen tessellates a DXF by spawning a Node child
(``cadgen._internal.node_runtime``), and finds that child through ``cadgen.assets.
node_builders_dir()`` -- the repo's live ``packages/cadgen-js/bin`` in a checkout, and the
packaged ``cadgen/_runtime/node`` in an installed wheel.

This is the regression guard for a failure that only ever appears at the far end: a
distribution that ships a producer but not its builder supports a format it cannot build,
and says so for the first time in the user's model directory. It asserts what an installed
cadgen needs and cannot get any other way -- the file is present, is a REAL file (a symlink
is dropped silently by Codex's plugin installer; see ``check-builds.sh``), and is
self-contained: no bare specifier survives that would need a ``node_modules`` the wheel
does not carry.

It used to assert the same thing per-skill, back when each skill vendored its own copy.
One copy inside cadgen replaced six, so the checks moved with them.
