"""No cadgen entry point restarts the interpreter to pin ``PYTHONHASHSEED``.

There used to be one, and it cost a whole second interpreter on every cold
drawing build. Drawing bytes were content-addressed while ezdxf's emitted order
followed string hashing, so a cold ``@dxf`` run re-ran itself with the seed
pinned — first from the retired `dxf gen` dispatch, then from the ``@dxf``
decorator, and briefly from a ``cadgen dxf build`` engine path. The re-run also
had a Windows hazard of its own (issue #245: ``os.execv`` does not quote, so an
interpreter path containing a space arrived as two arguments).

That whole apparatus is deleted. ``cadgen._internal.dxf_emit`` makes DXF bytes a
function of the drawing's geometry — layers sorted by name, edges sorted by
geometric content, ezdxf's volatile provenance pinned, and its CLASSES registry
(the actual seed-sensitive part) sorted — so the seed cannot reach the file.

The warm daemon is in scope too. Its workers used to be spawned with the seed
pinned, which was the same ritual by another route, and worse in one way: a
worker whose seed differed from every other process was a standing warm/cold
divergence, ready to hide the next ordering bug rather than reveal it.

This guard exists because the re-exec is easy to reintroduce and expensive:
it would silently double the cold cost of every drawing, and nothing else in
the suite would notice. If a genuine need for a stable seed ever returns, fix
the ordering that depends on it instead.
