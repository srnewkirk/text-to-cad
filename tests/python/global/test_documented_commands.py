"""Every `cadgen ...` command form a skill documents has to be a real command.

Skills are the product, and an agent runs what they say verbatim. A renamed or
retired command leaves the docs still confidently teaching it — that is how
`scripts/test/test-installed.sh` came to check four commands that no longer
existed, and how `cadgen step export` would have outlived its deletion.

So: extract the command forms out of the skills' own fenced code blocks and put
them through the real dispatcher's registry and the real parsers. Nothing is
executed — a smoke test may not build CAD — but a form that names a command that
is gone, or passes a flag that no longer exists, fails here
(design/format-doors.md, "executed docs").
