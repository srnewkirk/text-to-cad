"""Viewer format-identity checks may only go DOWN.

The viewer renders every format through one shared component stack, but historically
gated every feature per format with identity checks (``renderFormat === RENDER_FORMAT.X``,
``isMeshRenderFormat(...)``, the ``xxxMode`` boolean piles). Each one is a place a new
format must be hand-added and a place an improvement fails to reach the other formats.
That is not hypothetical: the Orbit button was gated off per format independently and
had to be fixed twice, and one format grew a parallel export route to an endpoint the
server does not implement.

The fix is the capability registry (``packages/cadgen-js/src/lib/renderCapabilities.js``):
code asks *what a format can do*, not *what it is*. This test ratchets the old pattern
downward so it cannot grow back — without it the count creeps up again one feature at a
time and the unification silently rots.

If this test fails because you ADDED an identity check: use a capability instead. If you
genuinely removed some, lower the budget in the same commit.
