"""One cache key per file type, and no hand-copied version that can drift.

Two rules, both learned the hard way.

The first: a cached artifact's version has to cover EVERYTHING about how that
artifact was produced -- the descriptor's layout and the bytes inside the payloads
it references. Split across two numbers, a fix ships half applied: the descriptor
advances while content-addressed payloads are reused unchanged, and the package
reports itself current while serving the old bytes.

The second: ``STEP_TOPOLOGY_SCHEMA_VERSION`` is a Python->JS wire contract, and the
JS client throws on a mismatch. It is declared once in each language, so nothing
but this test stops the two from drifting -- which is the same
"a second hand-copied number is how the two drift" failure that put the package
version in a stdlib-only module in the first place.
