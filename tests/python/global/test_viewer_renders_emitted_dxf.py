"""The Viewer must render every entity kind the DXF engine can write.

Two halves of one product, in two languages: `cadgen._internal.dxf_emit` writes
drawings through build123d's `ExportDXF`, and `packages/cadgen-js/src/lib/dxf/
parseDxf.js` is what the Viewer and the snapshot renderer read them back with.
An entity the engine emits and the parser does not know simply vanishes from the
render — a hole that is cut but not shown, which is the worst kind of silence in
a cut file.

The engine's set is not restated here as a constant; it is MEASURED, by building
a drawing that exercises every converter `ExportDXF` has (line, circle, arc,
ellipse, spline) and reading back what came out. So an upstream change that
starts emitting something new fails this test rather than the user's part.
