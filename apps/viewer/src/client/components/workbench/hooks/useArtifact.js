// useArtifact — the client half of the render-artifact pipeline.
//
// For the selected entry it resolves a single status: `ready` (render it), `generating` (a (re)build
// is running — show a loading state), or `error` (a fatal build/source failure). A missing or stale
// cache is NOT surfaced as an issue: the hook simply triggers a build and reports `generating`.
//
// Optimistic-ready: a freshly-selected entry starts `ready` so a fresh model renders immediately with
// no flash; only when the freshness check comes back `needs-build` do we flip to `compiling` (and
// the caller hides the now-known-stale render assets) and POST a build. Direct-render entries
// (`enabled: false`) never hit the network and stay `ready`.
//
// While the build POST is in flight it is polled for PROGRESS. The POST is one long-lived request
// that resolves only when the build finishes, so the position has to come from somewhere else: a
// concurrent GET of the same status route, which reads the record the build writes as it works.
// The poll is strictly read-only — it never triggers a build of its own — so the single POST stays
// the only writer no matter how long it runs.
//
// ATTACH vs BUILD. Only `not-compiled` POSTs. When the server reports `compiling`, some other
// process already holds this model's lock — a `cad gen` in a terminal, another tab — and we watch
// its run instead, re-resolving when it ends. Previously every non-ready state POSTed, so opening a
// model during a long CLI build meant waiting out that build and then paying for a full duplicate
// rebuild. Progress carries the server's `runId`; when it changes the bar resets, because the
// reported ratio is monotonic only within a single run and carrying it across a handoff is what
// made the bar jump backwards.
