// Dev runs the SAME backend as production — `cadgen viewer`, spawned as
// `python -m cadgen.viewer` — but as a second process that Vite proxies to,
// because a Python server cannot be in-process Vite middleware. `npm run dev`
// stays ONE command: this plugin spawns the backend on an ephemeral port, reads
// the port off its {url,port,action} line, and hands it to the proxy in the
// server block.
//
// The backend runs --ephemeral --no-registry --api-only. --no-registry is a
// CORRECTNESS requirement, not tidiness: a registered dev backend would be
// found by a later `cadgen viewer` launch from the same directory (reuse keys
// on the served realpath at the same version), handing an agent a URL served by
// Vite's proxy target instead of a real Viewer. --api-only is what makes dev
// work on a checkout that has never been built: Vite serves the client here, so
// this backend needs no dist/ — and dist/ is gitignored, so without it
// `npm run dev` failed on every fresh clone with a complaint about a missing
// build.
//
// VIEWER_PYTHON names the interpreter that has cadgen installed. Without it,
// prefer a nearby project virtual environment before using the platform PATH
// fallback. The resolved interpreter and source are logged at startup so an
// exit is attributable. See CONTRIBUTING.md for the checkout recipe.
//
// VIEWER_BACKEND_URL attaches to a backend you started yourself, which is also
// how you put a debugger on it.
// Resolved during CONFIG, not in configureServer: Vite builds the proxy
// middleware from `server.proxy` while creating the server, and http-proxy
// wants a plain string target — so the port has to be known before the config
// object exists. Vite supports an async config function, which is what makes
