# CAD Viewer

A local-filesystem CAD review app. This directory is the React CLIENT; the
backend is `cadgen viewer` — the `cadgen.viewer` package in the cadgen Python
distribution — and the built client ships inside that same wheel. One instance
serves ONE directory, fixed at start; the page is always the bare origin and
`?file=` selects an artifact inside that root. There is no hosted deployment.

**PURPOSE** — the application: all UI, workflow, and session state for
reviewing CAD artifacts (catalog, tabs, selection, pose, animation,
measurements, themes).

**MAY DEPEND ON** — `cadgen-js` (the shared CAD render/runtime package at
`packages/cadgen-js`, imported by the `cadgen-js` specifier) and its own npm
dependencies, all bundled into the client AT BUILD TIME. At run time it talks
to `cadgen viewer` over `/__cad` and `/__tess_cache`, and to nothing else.

**DEPENDED ON BY** — the cadgen wheel, which carries this client's build
(`cadgen/_runtime/viewer`). No code imports from this app.

## The laws that bind the app

- **One boundary**: the client imports `cadgen-js` by name and nothing else
  from outside this directory (`scripts/selfContained.test.mjs` is the fence).
  The backend is not here: its code, its tests and its laws live with cadgen.
- **Three-input law**: everything renders from the artifact file, its
  sidecar (`<name>.step.json`), and the cache. The viewer never reads
  source code and never rebuilds on source changes — generated outputs are
  detached, and a stale artifact stays stale until someone runs its script.
- **Kinematics/animation independence**: the Kinematics tab drives the sidecar's
  mate data through the shared FK runtime; the Animation tab evaluates the
  sidecar's copied `.anim.js` clips. They compose in the effect records and
  nowhere else.
- **Loud failure**: a missing entry, an unresolvable ref, or a failed
  compile surfaces as an alert — never a silently wrong scene.

## Launching

All commands run from this app's directory. Dev (Vite serves the client
from source with HMR; edits to `src/` and `packages/cadgen-js` show live):

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
# open http://127.0.0.1:5173/?file=<path relative to the served root>
```

Dev spawns the real backend — `python -m cadgen.viewer --api-only` on an
ephemeral port — and proxies `/__cad` and `/__tess_cache` to it, so there is one
implementation, not two, and Vite owns the client. `VIEWER_PYTHON` names the
interpreter that has cadgen installed (it defaults to `python3`, which on macOS
is still 3.9 — below the server's floor of 3.11 — and rarely the one with
cadgen); `VIEWER_BACKEND_URL` attaches to a backend you started yourself. No
build is needed first.

Prod is `cadgen viewer`, run FROM the directory to serve (there is no directory
flag, the cwd IS the served directory). In a checkout it serves this app's
`dist/` — build it first — and an installed wheel serves the copy it carries:

```bash
npm run build
cd <the directory to serve> && cadgen viewer --host 127.0.0.1 --json
```

The launcher is unconditional and prints the URL it serves: a live instance
already serving that realpath with the same code on disk is REUSED
(`action:"reused"`); otherwise it binds the first free port from 3245 upward.
`--new` forces a fresh instance of the same code; an explicit `--port` is
strict; `--dist DIR` (or `CADGEN_VIEWER_DIST`) names another built client. The
URL line (and the `--json` line) is written only after the socket is bound and
listening with the app attached, so the first request after reading it answers
— no poll, no retry, no grace period. `cadgen viewer list` shows every running
instance; `cadgen viewer stop --port <n>` ends one. Do not stop instances you
did not start. Dev lives on Vite's port (5173, strict) and never enters the
instance registry.

Reuse keys on realpath(served directory) × an identity token — the cadgen
version salted with the newest mtime across the server's `.py` files and the
built client — so an instance serving a different directory, the same directory
from another install, or code that has since been edited, pulled, or rebuilt is
never handed back by mistake. In a checkout, a server that finds `src/` beside
the `dist/` it serves also warns once on stderr when any source is newer than
the build — detection only; it keeps serving.

## Behaviours worth knowing before concluding something is broken

- **The catalog scan skips dot-directories.** A buildable entry under
  `.review/` (or any dotted path) never appears, even when the server is
  launched from inside it.
- **Verify a link by loading the page**, never by curling `/__cad/asset` —
  that route serves raw files; generated entries render through a
  different route, so probing it 404s whether or not anything is wrong.
- **Vite's transform cache can outlive HMR and hard reloads.** If a source
  edit does not show up, restart the dev server and delete
  `node_modules/.vite`.
- Never invoke the export routes from automation — they open native save-as
  dialogs.

## The shape of the app

```
src/client/ # React app: CadWorkspace (state root), CadViewer (scene +
            #   effects application), workbench/ (tabs, sections, session
            #   state, playback), render/ (viewport)
scripts/    # app tooling incl. e2e helpers and selfContained.test.mjs
            #   (the boundary fence) and the dev-backend spawn helpers
docs/       # subsystem docs; settings-ui.md is the CURATED design-system
            #   reference for all settings UI work — binding, read it
            #   before touching controls
dist/       # built client (gitignored); what `cadgen viewer` serves in a
            #   checkout and what the wheel bundles
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test    # client + app tooling (node:test, beside the code)
```

The backend's suite lives with cadgen and is not collected here; running only
`npm run test` leaves that half unchecked.

Headless UI verification uses Playwright with `--use-angle=metal` —
the default software WebGL renderer is not what users see.
