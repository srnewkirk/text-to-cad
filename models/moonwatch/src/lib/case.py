"""Case cluster for the moonwatch chronograph.

Case middle with twisted lyre lugs and asymmetric crown guard, tachymeter
bezel (steel ring + black insert + filled scale), hesalite-style domed
crystal, display caseback (sapphire + retaining ring), crown, pump pushers
(machined case bosses, slender collared tubes, short domed caps, coil
springs), gaskets, and spring bars.

Frame: WATCH frame per `_spec` — z = 0 at the case-middle / caseback joint
plane, +Z through the crystal, crown at +X.  All `build_*` functions return
parts already positioned in the watch frame; `build_case_parts()` returns the
full labeled, colored list.

Finishing (geometric, shared `_finishing` vocabulary): the lug top fields and
the exposed guard-top shoulder carry directional satin grain along Y (the
strap direction, `straight_grain_cutter`), the case flank's widest zone and
the bezel steel ring's top annulus carry fine circumferential/circular
graining, and everything else — the twisted lug bevel facets, bezel edge
chamfers, crown flutes, pusher caps — stays smooth as the polished contrast.
