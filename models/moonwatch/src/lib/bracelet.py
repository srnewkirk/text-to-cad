"""Flat three-link bracelet builder (moonwatch archetype).

Frame: WATCH assembly frame from `_spec` — +Z through the crystal, 12
o'clock at +Y, z = 0 at the case-middle/caseback joint. The bracelet
attaches at the spring-bar axes (y = +/-SPRING_BAR_Y, z = SPRING_BAR_Z)
and drapes outward along +/-Y on ONE smooth arc: the per-joint relative
pitch eases from DRAPE_DELTA0 to DRAPE_DELTA1 (2 -> 7 degrees), so
curvature grows monotonically like a bracelet resting over an invisible
wrist form, with no kink at any joint; the clasp chord continues the
same arc one increment further.

Construction vocabulary (all rows share it):

- A row is three separate bodies: two wider brushed outer links
  (BRACELET_OUTER) and a narrower polished center link (BRACELET_CENTER),
  so the center row reads brighter than the brushed outers.
- Row ends articulate on shared pin axes. At every joint the earlier
  row's OUTER links carry convex knuckle eyes (radius EYE_R, centered on
  the axis, deliberately SMALLER than the link half-thickness so the
  hinge stays below the top surface) and the later row's CENTER link
  carries the mating eye; the complementary ends are cut back with a
  concave recess of radius EYE_R + JOINT_CLEARANCE about the same axis,
  so any relative pitch articulates with a constant 0.06 radial
  clearance and zero interpenetration. Above and below the hinge the
  link ends are flat walls, cut PARALLEL TO THE JOINT BISECTOR (each
  end tilted by half the joint's posed relative pitch), so the two
  walls of every joint are parallel planes 2*SHUT_EDGE apart at every
  drape angle.
- Every joint gets a steel pin body (visible ends on the link flanks)
  passing through bores in the knuckle eyes.
- Width tapers linearly BRACELET_WIDTH_AT_LUG -> BRACELET_WIDTH_AT_CLASP
  over each strap; every link is planned as a trapezoid so the taper is
  smooth link to link.
- Every link carries a crowned cross-section baked into its planned
  SECTION (never post-chamfered): the top is a shallow arc across the
  link's own width (sagitta CROWN_SAG) flanked by crisp 45-degree bevel
  facets of leg BEVEL; the bottom is a flatter dome (CROWN_SAG_BOT) with
  the same bevels. The clasp outer plate, inner cover, and flip-lock bow
  sweep the same crowned+beveled section along the clasp curvature arc.
- Joint shutlines: every row end is finished as a ROLLED SHOULDER about
  its pin axis. The shutline walls stay parallel planes 2*SHUT_EDGE =
  0.28 apart (leaned onto each joint's bisector), but instead of meeting
  the crowned top at a scribed edge, each link's crown rolls over a
  convex quarter-round of radius ROLL_R — tangent to the crown ROLL_R
  before the wall and tangent to the wall itself — so the surface normal
  rotates through ~86-90 degrees at every link end and each row reads as
  its own convex pillow with a dark shadow valley at the joint. On
  knuckle-EYE ends the roll stops EYE_ROLL_DEPTH below the crown and a
  flat deck runs across the opening (shaving the knuckle crest), the
  whole cutter clamped above the pin bore roof (FLOOR_Z_MIN); on RECESS
  ends the roll runs the full quarter round into the full-height end
  wall. Laterally the center<->outer walls sit LINK_GAP apart and the
  facing top edges carry the same rolled treatment at radius R_LAT,
  baked into the lofted SECTION, so the three columns also read as
  separate convex bodies over parallel shadow grooves. All shutline cuts
  only REMOVE material, so the 0.06 articulation clearance is untouched.
- Directional finish: every link, end link, and clasp plate carries axial
  satin brushing on its crown — fine parallel V-grooves (pitch
  GRAIN_PITCH, depth GRAIN_DEPTH) along the LOCAL strap axis. Links and
  end links subtract shared `_finishing.straight_grain_cutter` tools
  seated groove-by-groove onto the crown arc (`_grain_field`) in the
  construction frame before posing, so the grain drapes with each link;
  the clasp plates bake the same V-notches into their swept section
  (`_crowned_band(grain=True)`) so the grooves follow the clasp's
  longitudinal curvature. Bevels, rolled shoulders, lateral shoulder
  rounds, and flanks are never grained: they stay mirror-polished
  against the satin field.
