"""W16 system model: valvetrain — 64 valves + springs + retainers + followers + HLAs.

A sub-assembly of the engine: the parts `lib/valvetrain.py` builds, as one model
with its own STEP, its own record and its own worker. `w16.py` links it as
occurrence `o1.5`; rebuild `w16.py` to pick up a change here.
