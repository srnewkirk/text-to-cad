"""W16 master spec — the single source of truth for every shared number.

ENGINE FRAME (all builders author directly in this frame, in mm)
  X   crank axis. +X = FRONT (timing drive, damper/pulley). -X = rear (flywheel,
      bell-housing face).
  Z   up.  Y lateral: +Y = bank 1 (cylinders 1-8), -Y = bank 2 (cylinders 9-16).
  Crank angle theta: right-hand rotation about +X. A radial direction at
  "angle a" is p(a) = (0, -sin a, cos a): a is measured from +Z toward -Y, so it
  INCREASES with theta.  Bank 1 sits at negative a, bank 2 at positive a.

ARCHITECTURE (settled against public references — see README):
  8.0 L (7993 cc), 86 x 86 mm, two narrow-angle VR8 banks (15 deg within a bank,
  rows at +/-7.5 deg from the bank centreline) set 90 deg apart on one crank.
  8 crankpins, each shared by one bank-1 rod and one bank-2 rod (cylinder i and
  i+8). Rows alternate along each bank (VR fashion) and the two rods on a pin
  belong to OPPOSITE rows (inner+outer), which is what makes every pin's two
  cylinders fire exactly 90 deg apart and the whole engine fire evenly at 45 deg.
  Firing order 1-14-9-4-7-12-15-6-13-8-3-16-11-2-5-10 (Bugatti's published order,
  cylinders numbered front to rear, 1-8 bank 1, 9-16 bank 2). The pin phasing is
  DERIVED from that order + even firing; it is not published.
  Cylinder axes are desaxe: each row's axis is offset DESAXE mm from the crank
  axis, away from the bank centreline (the VR6's 12.5 mm trick, which is what
  lets 86 mm bores sit 74 mm apart along the crank).
  Valvetrain: 4 cams (intake + exhaust per bank), each serving BOTH rows of its
  bank through roller finger followers on hydraulic pivots — one cam line cannot
  serve two rows of bucket tappets, and this is how real VR 4-valve heads do it.
