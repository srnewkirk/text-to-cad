# Prompt: One flat pattern that exercises every bend shape the 3D fold preview has to handle, so
# a fold regression shows up on a part instead of only in a unit test.
#
# Each bend is here for a reason, and they are deliberately NOT all alike:
#
#   bend 1  vertical, edge to edge     the ordinary case
#   bend 2  vertical, edge to edge     a second parallel bend, so up/up folds a U and up/down a Z
#   bend 3  HORIZONTAL, across a tab   perpendicular to bends 1-2, and a CHORD: it spans only the
#                                      tab's width, and the same infinite line continues along
#                                      the panel's bottom edge where no bend runs. A fold model
#                                      that cuts by each bend's infinite line slices the whole
#                                      blank here and folds material the bend does not separate.
#   bend 4  DIAGONAL across a corner   45 degrees, to hold the line that bend orientation is not
#                                      restricted to the axes. Inboard of the chamfer, since a
#                                      bend drawn ON a cut edge separates nothing.
#
# Every bend line ends ON the outline, because that is what makes a fold a fold: a brake needs
# the line to reach material's edge at both ends. Holes sit clear of the bend bands, since
# material inside a bend radius becomes the curve and cannot stay flat.
#
# Not covered here, deliberately: a bend whose ends stop short of the edge and rely on relief
# slits. The preview refuses those by design and names the shortfall; tom's link_bracket is the
# fixture for that case.
