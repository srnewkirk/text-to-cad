# drawings models

The repo's 2D `@dxf` fixtures as one cad-project: every script directly
under `src/` is a runnable drawing model and its artifact lands in `DXF/`.
Parts live in the sibling `models/examples/` project and assemblies in
`models/assemblies/`. Nothing here is committed except this `src/` tree and
`DXF/imported/` — build what you need.

```bash
python models/drawings/src/gasket_plate.py       # one drawing
ls models/drawings/src/*.py | xargs -n1 -P4 python   # every drawing
```

Unchanged drawings are no-ops. The one helper module lives in `src/lib/`
(`clamp_plate_profile`) — a plain module, never a model.

### Drawings

Small 2D `@dxf` fixtures for exercising the `dxf` skill tooling. Everything
here is intentionally simple so failures point at the tooling, not the fixture.
Written DXF bytes are a pure function of the returned geometry, so a rebuild
that changes them is a real change to report, not noise.

| Script | Artifact | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `angled_tab.py` | `DXF/angled_tab.dxf` | Plate with a corner gusset tab on a **45° bend line** |
| `cabinet_panel_drawing.py` | `DXF/cabinet_panel_drawing.dxf` | Workshop **drawing**: three views, engraved dimension callouts, title block |
| `clamp_plate.py` | `DXF/clamp_plate.dxf` | Cut profile projected from 3D topology (`lib/clamp_plate_profile.py`) |
| `gasket_plate.py` | `DXF/gasket_plate.dxf` | Rounded gasket, bolt holes, centre cutout, engraved crosshair |
| `l_bracket_flat.py` | `DXF/l_bracket_flat.dxf` | Sheet-metal flat pattern with a single bend line |
| `label_plate.py` | `DXF/label_plate.dxf` | Laser-cut label: engraved text outlines + an open score line |
| `multi_bend_test_panel.py` | `DXF/multi_bend_test_panel.dxf` | **Four bends in three orientations** on one blank |
| `u_channel_bracket.py` | `DXF/u_channel_bracket.dxf` | U-channel flat pattern with **two parallel** bend lines |

Together these cover the skill's standalone-drafting and topology-projection
workflows. `lib/clamp_plate_profile.py` is the clamp plate as a build123d
solid — a plain helper, not a `@step` model: the profile is projected from live
geometry rather than read back from a STEP artifact this project wrote (which
the `$dxf` skill forbids — the freshness gate could never say "current").

Build: `python src/<script>` per row; unchanged models are no-ops.
Imported sources: `DXF/imported/*.dxf` (committed, no script).

## Why the cabinet panel drawing exists

`cabinet_panel_drawing.py` is the only model here that is a **drawing document**
rather than a cut layout: three views (front elevation, plan, section A-A), the
eleven measurements a cabinetmaker needs, and a title block. It was a committed
baked file until its information was re-expressed in what `@dxf` actually emits —
geometry on layers that carry intent. The views and dowel holes are `CUT`;
everything annotative is `ENGRAVE`, so the dimension VALUES are `bd.Text`
outlines and the witness, leader, centre and shelf lines are open geometry, which
an engrave-intent layer allows. The DXF constructs the retired ezdxf generator
used — `DIMENSION` entities, ISO 128 `CENTER`/`HIDDEN` linetypes, a non-plotting
layer, `TEXT` entities — have no `@dxf` equivalent and are not reproduced; the
numbers they carried are. That generator is in git history at
`models/drawings/dxf/cabinet_panel_drawing.dxf.py`.

## Why each bend fixture exists

- `l_bracket_flat.py` — the ordinary case: one bend, edge to edge.
- `u_channel_bracket.py` — **two parallel** bends, so the web stays flat and
  both flanges fold the same way. Covers bend ordering and a segment bounded by
  a bend on both sides, which the single-bend L-bracket cannot exercise.
- `angled_tab.py` — arbitrary bend-line ORIENTATION. Every other bend fixture's
  lines are vertical, so a fold that only handles constant-X axes renders this
  one wrong.
- `multi_bend_test_panel.py` — the fold model itself: five faces, four hinges, a
  tree. Two parallel verticals, a horizontal tab fold whose line is a *chord*
  (it spans only the tab, and the same infinite line continues along the
  panel's bottom edge where no bend runs), and a 45° corner fold. This is the
  one that fails when a fold cuts by its infinite line instead of its own
  segment.

## `DXF/imported/` — committed inputs

Raw DXF files no script regenerates, committed via Git LFS and never rebuilt.
They cover R12 (AC1009) and R2013+ (AC1027) flavors and a spread of entity
types.

**Every file here encloses at least one closed area.** That is the selection
rule, and it exists because the viewer renders a DXF by extruding its closed cut
contours into a 3D flat pattern — a drawing with no area has nothing to extrude
and nothing to show.

Several of these deliberately mix closed cut profiles with open annotation
(dimension extension lines, stray arcs), because real drawings do — layer
intent is what separates the two, not the entity type.

From [skymakerolof/dxf](https://github.com/skymakerolof/dxf) (`test/resources`,
MIT):

- `alu_extrusion_profile.dxf` — an aluminium extrusion cross-section: nine
  nested closed LWPOLYLINE chambers, two HATCH regions, and seven DIMENSION
  annotations across several layers and colors. The most realistic engineering
  part in the set. Upstream name: `alu-profile.dxf`.
- `plate_four_holes.dxf` — an OpenSCAD 2D export: a plate outline with four
  circular holes, written as 452 individual LINE segments that chain into
  closed loops with no dangling ends. Exercises the contour walk hard, since
  not one entity is closed on its own. Upstream name: `openscad_export.dxf`.
- `square_and_circle.dxf` — a square outline with an inscribed circle on
  separate colored layers; the circle is tangent to the square, a useful
  near-degenerate case for contour resolution. Upstream name:
  `squareandcircle.dxf`.
- `block_square_in_circle.dxf` — a circle plus an INSERT whose block holds a
  closed square, and a second standalone circle. Small, and the simplest file
  here that requires block expansion. Upstream name: `accumulatortest.dxf`.
- `circles_ellipses_arcs.dxf` — two closed ELLIPSE entities and a CIRCLE
  alongside two open ARCs. Closed-area ellipse coverage with open geometry
  mixed in. Upstream name: `circlesellipsesarcs.dxf`.

From [gdsestimating/dxf-parser](https://github.com/gdsestimating/dxf-parser)
(`test/data`, MIT):

- `laser_text_outlines.dxf` — the word "LaserWeb" as twelve legacy POLYLINE
  letter outlines, including the counters inside `a`, `e` and `b`. Closed by
  coincident first/last vertices rather than the closed flag, so it also covers
  that distinction. A genuine laser-cut profile. Upstream name: `polylines.dxf`.
- `overlapping_ellipses.dxf` — two full closed ELLIPSE entities that overlap.
  Minimal ellipse coverage. Upstream name: `ellipse.dxf`.

From [mozman/ezdxf](https://github.com/mozman/ezdxf) (`examples_dxf`, MIT):

- `nested_hole_shapes.dxf` — eight shapes with nested holes: rectangles inside
  rectangles, notched profiles, and pentagons, as sixteen closed LWPOLYLINE
  boundaries with ten HATCH fills. The best coverage of holes and nesting
  depth. Upstream name: `hatches_1.dxf`.

Authored in-repo (committed because no script here can rebuild them):

- `bracket_inches.dxf` — a small bracket profile authored with `$INSUNITS = 1`
  (inches). The units fixture: the parser scales every coordinate to
  millimetres, and a drawing baked before that support existed came out 25.4×
  too small. Its LWPOLYLINEs omit the `AcDbPolyline` subclass marker, so
  ezdxf's strict reader refuses it while cadgen's own parser accepts it — which
  is itself the point of keeping it.

`DIMENSION`-entity coverage lives in `alu_extrusion_profile.dxf`. DXF `TEXT` and
`MTEXT` entities are covered by unit fixtures in
`packages/cadgen-js/src/lib/dxf/parseDxf.test.js`, not by a file here — the
cabinet panel drawing that used to hold that coverage is now generated, as
`src/cabinet_panel_drawing.py`.

Validate any file here post-hoc with the drawing checks (there is no
`--validate` flag; a clean drawing reports no findings):

```python
from cadgen.drawing_checks import validate_dxf_file

print([finding.render() for finding in validate_dxf_file("DXF/gasket_plate.dxf")])
```
