# examples models

Standalone demo parts as one cad-project: every script directly under
`src/` is a runnable part model and its artifact lands in a format folder at
the project root (`STEP/`, `STL/`, `3MF/`, `GLB/`). Assemblies live in the
sibling `models/assemblies/` project (one group per assembly) and 2D drawings
in `models/drawings/`. Nothing here is committed except this `src/` tree and
`imported/` — build what you need.

```bash
python models/examples/src/mounting_plate.py     # one model
ls models/examples/src/*.py | xargs -n1 -P4 python   # every part
```

Unchanged models are no-ops, so "build if missing" and "rebuild" are the same
command. Shared helper modules live in `src/lib/` (`part_common`,
`simple_model_library`) — plain modules, never models.
Because the scripts sit directly in `src/`, `from lib import ...` resolves with
no path setup.

A handful of models declare mesh exports so the STL/3MF/GLB doors have real
fixtures to work against.

`imported/import-smoke.step` is a committed SOURCE file (the viewer launch
test's fixture), not an output.
