# juno models

`juno.py` is the full robot; the other 28 scripts each build ONE URDF link in
its own part-local frame, exporting both a STEP part and the millimetre 3MF
mesh that `../juno.urdf` references. The robot composes those same models by
CALLING them — a stale link builds on its own worker, a current one loads,
and the robot links its tree — so the assembly and the URDF meshes can never
disagree, and rebuilding a link alone leaves the robot to be rerun.

Build one: `python src/<script>.py`; unchanged models are no-ops.
Build the lot: `ls src/*.py | xargs -n1 -P4 python`.

`src/lib/` holds the shared part builders (`chain.py` is the kinematic
chain/pose/limit spec mirrored by `../juno.urdf` and `../juno.srdf`;
`juno_lib.py` is the shared style/geometry vocabulary). Nothing in `lib/` is
a model — it carries no `@step`.

`STEP/juno.step.js` sits beside `STEP/juno.step` — the render module the
viewer loads by name. Authored and committed; no build reads it.
