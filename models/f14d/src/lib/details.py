"""F-14D -- the detail layer: what makes it a USED CARRIER AIRCRAFT.

Everything here is small, and almost all of it is placed by QUERYING THE SKIN
(``sections.surfaces``) rather than by guessing a coordinate, so a fairing, a
scribe line or an antenna stays welded to the surface when the loft is retuned.
Three surface samplers do that work -- ``_flank`` (parameterised by station and
height), ``_deck`` and ``_belly`` (parameterised by station and lateral offset).
Each returns a point AND the outward surface normal, and every conformal thing
in this module -- blisters, panels, formation strips, panel-line grooves,
fastener rows -- is built from one of them.

What is here
------------
* The F-14D signature: the TWIN CHIN POD under the radome -- AN/AAS-42 IRST in
  the port lobe, AN/AXX-1 TCS in the starboard lobe -- as ONE faired housing
  with two optical windows.  An F-14A has a bare chin; this is the recognition
  feature and it is modelled as a blended twin-lobe loft, not two cylinders.
* The aircraft's real ASYMMETRY: M61A1 muzzle fairing, blast trough and gun-gas
  purge louvres on the PORT side only; the retractable refuelling probe bay on
  the STARBOARD side only.  Getting these on the wrong sides is the single
  cheapest way to make a Tomcat look wrong.
* Air data: AOA cone (port), pitot head (starboard), total temperature probe.
* Aerials: dorsal and ventral blades, dielectric panels, formation light strips,
  anti-collision beacons, glove position lights, port approach indexer.
* Service: NACA flush inlets, cooling scoops, ECS louvre exhausts, drains,
  boarding ladder door, kick steps and grab handles.
* Structure that READS: panel-line grooves cut into the skin in ONE batched
  multi-tool subtract (published through ``skin_cutters()``) and fastener domes placed
  as shared instances -- never as thousands of boolean cuts.

Scale discipline.  At 19 m over 1920 px one pixel is about 10 mm, so a scribed
line only reads because the edge overlay draws feature edges: grooves here are
11 mm wide and 4.5 mm deep, which is the narrowest that still produces an edge
pair.  Fastener domes are 2.6 mm proud spheres -- invisible at aircraft scale,
correct in a close-up, and free, because they are instanced, not cut.

    Solves for the lateral offset where the skin passes through ``z``: above the

    two branches are monotone in y so a bisection is exact and cheap.  Returns
    ``((x, y, z), (0, ny, nz))`` with the normal pointing out of the aircraft.

    If ``z`` is above the crown (or below the keel) the bisection collapses to
