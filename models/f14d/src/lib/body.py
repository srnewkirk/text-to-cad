"""The F-14D airframe skin: one lofted solid, nose to nozzles.

This is the piece the whole aeroplane hangs off.  It is a SINGLE multi-section
loft through the blended sections in ``sections.py`` -- forebody, gloves,
inlets, nacelles and the pancake tunnel are one surface, not separate bodies
fused together.  Nothing here is filleted, because there is nothing to fillet:
the transitions come out of the section maths already continuous.
