"""F-14D -- the two F110-GE-400 convergent-divergent exhaust nozzles.

Everything here is a body of revolution, or a SECTOR of one, about the engine
axis at ``(y = +-G.Y_NACELLE, z = G.nacelle(x)[3] == 0)``.  Building the petals
as revolved sectors rather than lofted plates is what keeps them exactly
conformal to the nozzle cone: every petal, seal and liner shares one meridional
radius law, so the ring closes on itself with no gaps and no lofting artefacts,
and the only thing that distinguishes a petal from the seal beside it is its
angular width and its radial offset.

State: PARKED, engines off.  With hydraulic pressure gone the F110 nozzle
relaxes to the fully OPEN position, so the external petals lie almost parallel
to the axis -- a shallow 6-8 deg cone with a knuckle just aft of the hinge --
rather than the steep cone of a nozzle at mil power.  That is what makes a
parked Tomcat's exhausts read as two big open holes.

The ring is flaps AND seals, not 18 plates butted edge to edge.  18 external
flaps at 13.6 deg of the 20 deg pitch leave a 6.4 deg gap; an external SEAL,
dropped 32 mm radially inboard, bridges each gap and tucks 6.6 deg UNDER the
flap edge on both sides.  That is the real overlap, and it is what turns the
nozzle into a scalloped ring of overlapping plates instead of a cone.  The
divergent ring inside is built the same way, so the throat reads as an iris of
individual plates too.

Depth is built, not painted.  Looking in you pass the external flap lip, the
seal shell, the 18 divergent flaps flaring out of the throat, the throat
itself, and then 0.8 m of afterburner interior -- liner, flameholder ring,
radial gutters -- going to black.
