"""Material palette for the F-14D.

COLOUR SPACE.  The render pipeline treats build123d ``Color`` channels as
LINEAR RGB and converts to sRGB for display, so ``Color(0.5,0.5,0.5)`` shows as
about ``#BCBCBC``.  Every colour here is authored as the sRGB hex you want to
SEE and converted by :func:`srgb`.  Never hand-write float triples.

COLOUR ON A GROUP IS IGNORED.  Only leaf occurrences carry colour into the
render package.  Use :func:`style` on every leaf.

Scheme: mid-1990s Tactical Paint Scheme (TPS) low-vis greys.  Chosen over
high-vis because the F-14's whole shape argument is made by its surface --
a two-tone grey with a hard demarcation lets the eye read the blend from glove
to nacelle to pancake, where 1970s gloss white bellies and coloured tails
would fight it.  The greys are the real FS numbers.

# somewhere to land, which a uniformly low-vis jet deliberately does not.

# Black is #1A1C20, not #000000: a true black loses every edge and crease under
