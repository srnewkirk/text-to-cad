"""F-14D cockpit: the opening, the transparencies, and everything under them.

THE SURFACE ARGUMENT
--------------------
``body.py`` lofts the airframe skin THROUGH the canopy's own outer surface --
``geometry.canopy_lobe`` is a lobe of the section blend like any other, so the
body already carries the bubble as solid material.  This module therefore does
two halves of one job:

1. It CUTS the cockpit opening out of that bubble.  The cutter is exposed as
   :func:`skin_cutters`, in the WATERLINE frame, before ``stance()``; the
   airframe module applies it to the skin.
2. It rebuilds the transparency FROM THE SAME FUNCTIONS -- every outer point of
   the canopy, the windscreen and every frame is ``sections.surfaces(x, y)``.
   The glass is literally the surface that was removed, so it sits exactly on
   the skin it came from and the canopy-to-spine fairing at the aft bow is
   continuous by construction rather than a gap that has to be fudged shut.

Nothing here hard-codes a canopy coordinate.  In particular the SILL and the
RAIL line are SOLVED against the surface, not assumed.  The first attempt put
the sill a fixed drop below the forebody crown line and the rail band came out
inverted: the bubble's flank is very nearly vertical at its foot -- at the apex
station the skin falls 140 mm in the 25 mm of half-width outboard of it -- so
the deck beside the canopy is already 120 mm BELOW the crown.  The sill is
therefore taken from the skin at the lobe silhouette, and the rail from a fixed
HEIGHT above that sill, which is what makes it a constant-looking band instead
of a fin that grows with the bubble.

IMPORT ORDER.  ``airframe`` imports this module for :func:`skin_cutters`, so
this module must NOT import ``airframe`` at module level -- ``stance`` is
imported lazily inside :func:`build`.  The cycle then never closes at import
time whichever module is loaded first.

    roofed by a shelf that runs OUTBOARD of the rim.

    Twelve points every station so the loft matches index for index.  Above the
    sill the cut takes the whole bubble out to ``W_CUT``; below it the well
    steps inboard to ``W_TUB``, and the ledge that step leaves IS the sill the
    canopy rail and its seal sit on.

    THE RIM ROOF, AND WHY THE RIM CANNOT BE A BARE WALL
    ---------------------------------------------------
    The first cutter stopped at ``(W_CUT, SILL)`` and went straight up.  The
    lip -- the band of skin standing between the sill ledge and the surface --
    was then bounded ABOVE by wherever the boolean found the skin, which is a
    surface/surface intersection running for 3.3 m only ``SILL_DROP`` away from
    the wall's own foot.  That is not a robust thing to ask for, and it did not
    survive contact with the skin we actually loft.

    The lofted skin does not sit on ``sections.surfaces``.  Rays cast at the rim
    line put it ABOVE the analytic surface at 47 of 49 sampled stations, by up
    to 84 mm, and near x = 6.29 m it plunges 71 mm BELOW: the canopy lobe's
    foot is not one of the rails ``sections.rails`` pins samples to, so the two
    section samples that bracket the rim are 87..129 mm apart, the spline rounds
    that knee into a welt, and the welt collapses where the inlet arrives and
    the rails jump outboard.  With the wall's foot only 22 mm under a surface
    that wanders 155 mm, the lip's top edge and the sill edge met tangentially
    at x = 6.30 m, the intersection folded back 9 mm in x, and the skin came out
    with a self-intersecting wire -- ``invalidTopology`` on ``airframe_skin``.
    The error is measured in the skin loft, so no tolerance, ``ShapeFix`` pass
    or fuzzy boolean can reach it; only the cut's shape can.

    So the lip is bounded by the CUTTER instead.  At ``W_CUT`` the wall rises
    exactly ``SILL_DROP`` -- to ``SURF(x, W_CUT(x))``, the rim height the sill
    was measured down from -- and then turns OUTBOARD as a flat roof reaching
    ``RIM_SHELF``.  Three things follow:

    * The lip's top edge is now a cutter line at a known height, not a computed
      intersection, so the ribbon is ``SILL_DROP`` tall by construction.
    * The roof crosses the skin at 11..37 deg, transversally, and it does so
      only where the loft's welt stands above the intended surface -- a 6..45 mm
      land, measured on the cut, which is what shaves the welt off flush with
      the rim.
    * Where the skin dives under the whole rim (the 6.29 m collapse) the cut
      simply finds no material.  Nothing has to meet anything tangentially for
      that to be a legal answer.

    ``RIM_SHELF`` only has to outrun the welt, and 180 mm is four times what it
    takes: the roof has left the skin within 45 mm, and 200 mm outboard the
    intended surface has already fallen 58..250 mm below the rim, so the wall
    that closes the cutter off at ``W_CUT + RIM_SHELF`` never touches the
    aircraft.  Since nothing is cut outboard of the welt, the shelf does not
    have to be faded out at the ends of the opening either.
