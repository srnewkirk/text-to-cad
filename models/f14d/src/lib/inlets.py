"""F-14D inlets: boundary-layer diverter, raked cowls, ramps and ducts.

The rectangular inlet boxes -- splayed outboard, raked back at the lip, standing
130 mm clear of the fuselage on a boundary-layer diverter slot -- are the single
most recognisable thing about a Tomcat after the planform.  Everything here is
built in the WATERLINE frame; :func:`build` applies ``stance`` once at the end.

Two halves, and why
-------------------
The airframe skin is lofted with the diverter slot FILLED (see ``PANCAKE_TOP``
in ``geometry.py``): a station taken through an open slot is two disconnected
regions and cannot be lofted as one closed wire.  It is also lofted with a
rounded blob where the inlet mouth should be, because the nacelle lobe simply
switches on at ``X_INLET_LIP`` and the loft flares into it over one station
interval.  Neither can be fixed in the section maths.  So this module publishes

    skin_cutters() -- solids, WATERLINE frame, for ``skin - skin_cutters()``
    cutters()      -- the same list

and the airframe module applies them.  One fused cutter per side carries three
jobs:

* the DIVERTER SLOT -- a flat-walled channel from the fuselage side
  (``Y_SPLITTER``) to the inner cowl wall (``Y_INLET_INNER``), roofed just under
  the glove and running aft until it fades into the belly.  Cutting it is also
  what gives the fuselage side and the inner cowl their crisp machined walls
  instead of the lofted blend.
* the NOSE CHOP -- everything in the nacelle envelope forward of the raked lip
  plane.  This deletes the loft's blob and leaves the nacelle starting on a
  clean 15 deg raked face, which is the real lip line.
* the DUCT -- the capture envelope driven aft and morphed toward the circular
  engine face, so the inlet reads as a deep hole rather than a dimple.

The visible bodies in :func:`build` then line that cavity: a rounded cowl lip,
a three-stage duct liner that darkens with depth, the three upper ramps with
their perforated bleed panel, the slot liner and splitter rail, and the cowl's
bypass doors, bleed louvres and fastener rows.

Ramps are RETRACTED (flush), which is the parked state.
