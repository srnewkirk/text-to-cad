Build: `python src/f14d.py` builds the aircraft and every stale system beneath
it (in parallel, one worker each) and links their results; unchanged models
are no-op. `python src/<system>.py` builds one system alone — the aircraft does
not pick it up until `f14d.py` is rerun. It is a long build cold (the
airframe skin's structural cuts dominate, ~6 minutes on their own), so let it
run; every other system is done long before the airframe is.

`STEP/f14d.step.js` is not a model — it is the render module beside the
document, and the CAD Viewer's Animation tab is its only consumer (clips:
`teardown`, `explodedHold`). Authored and committed; no build reads it.

`lib/` is the shared part library: one module per aircraft system, each
exporting `build()`, wrapped by the model of the same stem under `src/`.
Nothing in `lib/` is runnable. The SYSTEMS list in `f14d.py` IS the occurrence
order (`o1.1` airframe through `o1.10` details); read its docstring before
adding or removing a system: a new group renumbers every occurrence after it
and `f14d.step.js` must be renumbered in the same commit. Which skin cutters
the airframe applies (and which were dropped as too costly) is decided in
`src/airframe.py`.

Project tooling lives outside `src/` because it is not model code:

- `../validate.py` — bilateral-symmetry check plus `inspect validate` and
  `inspect interfere`.
- `../render/` — review-render helpers (`shot.py`, `gauntlet.py`, `part.py`,
  `ab.py`, `subrefs.py`) and the committed presentation theme/display JSON.
  `subrefs.py` regenerates the act-2 occurrence-id lists in `f14d.step.js`.
  All of them write to `../tmp/`.
