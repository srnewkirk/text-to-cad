"""Grumman F-14D Super Tomcat -- full assembly.

Wings at 20 degrees, canopy closed, gear down, on the deck.  Clean airframe:
empty pylon stations, no external stores.

The airframe skin is ONE lofted solid (``src/lib/body.py``) built from
full-width blended sections, so the glove flows into the forward fuselage, the
nacelles flow into the pancake tunnel, and the fin roots sit on a continuous
surface.  Nothing in the primary surface is filleted, because nothing there is
joined.

Assembly tree is grouped BY SYSTEM — ten sibling models under ``src/``,
composed here by CALLING them — which is also how ``f14d.step.js`` moves
things: act 1 of the teardown addresses one system per ref.

OCCURRENCE ORDER IS THE ``SYSTEMS`` LIST BELOW, and the animation module's
occurrence refs are numbered against it:

    o1.1  airframe    the one-piece blended skin, cut and detailed
    o1.2  cockpit     tub, panels, seats, HUD, canopy, windscreen
    o1.3  wings       panels, slats, flaps, spoilers, tip lights
    o1.4  inlets      ramps, splitters, bleed slots, ducts
    o1.5  nozzles     C-D nozzles, petals, seals, actuator rings
    o1.6  empennage   fins, rudders, stabilators, ventral fins
    o1.7  aft         speed brakes, beavertail, tailhook, dump mast
    o1.8  nose_gear   leg, wheels, launch bar, doors, bay
    o1.9  main_gear   legs, wheels, brakes, doors, bays
    o1.10 details     antennas, probes, lights, wicks, vents, panels

Three systems the brief names -- glove, engines, markings -- have no model
yet; add one as ``src/<name>.py`` and insert it here, renumbering
``f14d.step.js`` in the same commit. A system that fails to build fails the
aircraft (nothing is skipped silently any more; the store keeps the last good
result of every other system, so the fix rebuilds only the broken one).

Which skin cutters the airframe applies is decided in ``src/airframe.py``.

The aircraft declares NO kinematics: nothing about it articulates, and the
staged teardown is choreography, which lives whole in ``f14d.step.js``.
