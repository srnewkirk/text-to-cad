# Migrating a CAD project from cadgen 0.4 to 0.5

This is a hand-migration playbook. Work through it top to bottom with a v0.4
project open and you will end with a working v0.5 project. Nothing else is
required — no other document, no tool.

## Read this first: there is no compatibility layer

v0.5 ships **zero** backwards compatibility. Deliberately:

- No shims, no aliases, no deprecated keyword arguments.
- No codemod. Nothing rewrites your sources.
- **No teaching errors.** A v0.5 tool handed a v0.4-shaped call reports only
  what its *current* contract requires. A retired flag is an unrecognized
  argument. A retired job key is an unknown key. A `gen_step()` file is a file
  that declares no model. None of those errors will mention 0.4, migration, or
  what the thing used to be called.

So: when something fails during this migration, the error tells you what v0.5
wants, not what you did. Read it as a spec, not as a diagnosis. That is the
design — every entry point teaches exactly one contract, the current one.

The corollary is that a **half-migrated project fails confusingly**. A model
script converted to `@step` whose stale v0.4 sidecar is still on disk fails at
the sidecar, not at the script. Do the deletion step (step 5) before you start
debugging anything.

### The one-paragraph summary

A v0.5 **model** is a plain `.py` file that decorates one **parameterless**
function with `@step`, `@dxf`, or a mesh decorator, and you build it by
**calling it**: the file ends with `if __name__ == "__main__": model()` and you
run `python model.py`. There is no generation CLI. A model's outputs are exactly
what its decorators declare — a STEP, a DXF, an STL, any mix — written where
`out=` says; everything derived lands in a content-addressed **store** under
`~/.cache/cadgen`. An assembly is a model that imports its part models and calls
them; the children build in parallel and the parent **links** their results.
Generated files carry no trace of their source.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11+ and a working v0.5 install.**

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # from your project
   python -m playwright install chromium       # only if you render snapshots
   ```

   A project's `requirements.txt` names the distribution, with the snapshot
   extra if you render:

   ```
   cadgen[snapshot]
   ```

   In v0.4 a skill vendored cadgen through an editable path
   (`--editable ./scripts/packages/cadgen`) and named `playwright` separately.
   Replace that line.

2. **Confirm what you actually have.**

   ```bash
   cadgen doctor            # prints the installed cadgen and checks a pin
   ```

   v0.4 installed one console script, `cadgen-step-artifact`. v0.5 installs
   `cadgen`. If `cadgen` is missing, the install did not take.

3. **Commit your work.** This migration deletes generated files.

4. **Keep a v0.4 build around if you care about geometry equivalence.** Note
   the occurrence, face and edge counts and the bounds of each primary STEP
   (`inspect refs --facts`, see step 7) so you can compare after. If you do not
   care, skip it — snapshots are usually enough.

## Migration checklist

Do these in order. Later steps assume earlier ones.

- [ ] 1. Rewrite imports
- [ ] 2. Convert the generator into a model
- [ ] 3. Convert composition: children are models you call
- [ ] 4. Move articulation to kinematics + the render module (`<name>.step.js`)
- [ ] 5. Reshape the project layout, then delete v0.4 leftovers
- [ ] 6. Rebuild
- [ ] 7. Verify

### 1. Rewrite imports

**Canonical import.** Every model script imports build123d through cadgen:

```python
# before (0.4)                      # after (0.5)
from build123d import Box, Cylinder from cadgen import build123d as bd
import build123d as bd              from cadgen import step
```

`cadgen.build123d` is a lazy, transparent re-export: `bd.Box` **is**
build123d's `Box` — same object, so `isinstance`, subclassing and `except`
clauses behave identically. The laziness is the point. A model script's module
body must stay cheap so the call can run the freshness gate and hand off to the
warm daemon *before* anything pays the ~2.5 s kernel import. A current model's
re-run then never wakes the kernel at all.

Raw `import build123d` still works and is not an error — it just costs ~2.5 s
on every re-run, and the call prints a hint on stderr when it sees the kernel
already imported. The same goes for `bd.<anything>` in a module-level constant
or a default argument: each one resolves the attribute at import.

Use **attribute style**. `from cadgen.build123d import Box` works but is eager:
a from-import must bind the object, which forces the real import immediately.

**Imports: module top by preference, not by rule.** A model runs like
`python script.py` — its folder stays on `sys.path` for the whole build — so an
import inside the body or a helper resolves the same way, and the file it loads
is hashed when it executes, so it is tracked either way. Module-top imports keep
the graph visible up front; that is the only reason to prefer them.

**Import roots are yours to declare.** cadgen adds nothing to the import path
that `python script.py` would not: the script's folder, then your `PYTHONPATH`.
It infers no project root from directory names (v0.4's `STEP/` and
`robot_common/` ancestor rules are gone). A project whose models import from a
shared root — `from lib.dims import W` two folders down — declares that root
the standard Python way, `PYTHONPATH=src`, and the daemon carries it into every
build it runs for you.

**Reading a vendor STEP.** Use `cadgen.read_step`, never
`build123d.import_step`:

```python
# before (0.4)                              # after (0.5)
from build123d import import_step           from cadgen import read_step, step

motor = import_step("imported/motor.step")  motor = read_step(_HERE / "imported" / "motor.step")
```

The returned shape is identical (the root itself, not a wrapper, with
per-occurrence and prototype STEP colors applied), and it is served from the
store, so a warm read costs tens of milliseconds instead of a full text-STEP
re-parse. `read_step` also **declares the file**: its content hash joins the
model's closure, so replacing the vendor STEP makes the model stale. A file
read as data by `import_step` announces nothing, and in v0.4 such a model kept
reporting itself current.

**The flatten projection helpers are gone.** v0.4's `cadgen.flatten` sampled
wires into point lists, unioned polygons in shapely, and emitted polylines.
v0.5 replaced that pipeline with exact OCC operations on the real faces, and
the sampling-era helpers were removed with it — a drawing built on them fails
with `AttributeError` at the point of emission:

| Removed (0.4) | Replacement (0.5) |
| --- | --- |
| `flatten.union_projected_faces` | `flatten.union_faces(flatten.flatten_faces(faces))` — exact OCC union of flattened faces |
| `flatten.project_face_polygon` | `flatten.flatten_face(face)` — lays the real face into XY; arcs stay arcs |
| `flatten.project_wire_points` | None. Nothing samples wires any more; return the flattened face itself |
| `flatten.add_shapely_geometry` | None. A `@dxf` function returns build123d 2D geometry; the engine writes the DXF |
| `flatten.add_ring` | Model the ring as geometry: an outer face with the inner contour as a hole |
| `flatten.add_circle_polyline` | Model the circle: `bd.Circle(r)` exports as a DXF `CIRCLE`, not a chord run |
| `cadgen.step_scene.import_step` | `cadgen.read_step` (see above) |

`flatten.flat_pattern(part, coordinate=..., kerf=...)` is the one-call form:
selection + flatten + union + optional kerf offset. It selects the planar faces
at ONE coordinate, so it unfolds a flat plate but **not a folded bracket**.
Unfolding a multi-panel part is the caller's job: select each panel's faces with
`flatten.planar_faces(...)` per plane, flatten each with its own placement, and
fuse with `flatten.union_faces(...)`. A worked multi-plane example lives in the
dxf skill's `references/generator-templates.md`.

### 2. Convert the generator into a model

This is the structural change. A v0.4 source had a magic `gen_step()` /
`gen_dxf()` function and usually a `<name>.step.py` / `<name>.dxf.py` filename.
v0.5 reads neither.

```python
# bracket.step.py (0.4)              # bracket.py (0.5)
from build123d import Box            from cadgen import build123d as bd
                                     from cadgen import step

def gen_step():                      @step(out="../STEP/bracket.step")
    return Box(10, 10, 10)           def bracket():
                                         return bd.Box(10, 10, 10)


                                     if __name__ == "__main__":
                                         bracket()
```

Mechanically:

1. **Rename the file to a plain `.py`.** `bracket.step.py` → `bracket.py`.
2. **Name the function after the file and decorate it** with `@step` (or
   `@dxf`, or a mesh decorator). Both bare (`@step`) and configured
   (`@step(...)`) forms work.
3. **Remove every parameter.** A model takes **no arguments** — a parameter of
   any kind, defaulted or not, is rejected. Parametric geometry is a plain
   factory function the model calls; another configuration is another model
   (another file). See "Mirrored parts" in step 3.
4. **Return the bare shape.** The v0.4 envelope dict (`{"shape": ..., "stl":
   ...}`) is gone; a `@step` function returns one build123d `Shape`. Mesh
   outputs are decorators (below).
5. **End the file with the call.** `if __name__ == "__main__": bracket()`.
   Decorating no longer runs anything; **calling the model is the build.**
   Without the guard, `python bracket.py` does nothing.
6. **A model's identity is the script plus the function** (`plate.py::plate`).
   One model per file is the recommendation: a file holding one is named by
   its path alone everywhere and writes `<file>.<fmt>`. A file may hold several (a
   variant family); each is its own record, output (`<function>.<fmt>`) and job,
   and all share the file's closure.

#### Decorator arguments

`@step` takes, all keyword-only:

| Argument | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `out=` | Output path. **Script-relative** (see the path note below). Default: sibling `<stem>.step`. |
| `kinematics=` | The typed-mates dict. See step 4. |
| `mesh_tolerance=` | Chord tolerance for the tree's tessellation. Relative — see step 6. |
| `mesh_angular_tolerance=` | Angular tolerance, radians. |

`@dxf` takes **only `out=`**. It has no `kinematics=` (a drawing is 2D
geometry); passing it is an error. **No decorator takes `animation=`** —
choreography is a file beside the document, not a declaration (step 4).

There is no `kind=`. v0.5 briefly accepted `kind="part"|"assembly"` and
inferred one from the return statement; both are deleted. What a model
returns IS the geometry — a `Compound` placing children is packaged as
occurrences, a single solid as one component — and `inspect` reports
`part`/`assembly` off the resulting tree. No decorator argument changes the
geometry a model produces.

Every decorator argument — `out=`, the two tolerances, `kinematics=` — is
ordinary Python evaluated when the module loads: an f-string, `NAME + ".step"`,
a constant imported from `lib/`, a dict built at import. Nothing is parsed off
the source text, and the values behind an argument are tracked like any other
input. Unknown keyword arguments are rejected outright on every decorator; a
bad value (an empty `out=`, a non-numeric tolerance) is refused at import.

#### The one path-semantics exception

Every CLI and function path argument in v0.5 is **native**: a relative path
resolves against the process's current working directory, an absolute path
works anywhere, and `~` expands. v0.4's cwd-gated and repo-gated behaviours are
gone.

The single deliberate exception is the **decorator's `out=`** — on `@step`,
`@dxf`, `@stl`, `@glb` and `@threemf` alike — which resolves relative to the
**script**. That is what makes a project relocatable: the declaration travels
with the model and produces the same layout whatever directory you run from.
There is **no per-run output override**: `-o`/`--output` does not exist. Where a file lands is a property of
the model, not of a run.

```python
@step(out="../STEP/bracket.step")   # ../STEP relative to THIS FILE
def bracket(): ...
```

#### What the function returns

A `@step` function returns a build123d `Shape` — nothing else. A `@dxf` function
returns build123d 2D geometry: a bare shape goes to the `CUT` layer, or a
`{layer: shape}` dict gives named layers (`CUT` / `ENGRAVE` / `SCORE`). The
engine writes the file; you never call an exporter.

#### Mesh exports are decorators — and STEP is optional

v0.4 produced meshes with a separate `scripts/export` run. v0.5 declares them
on the model, and every build produces them:

```python
# before (0.4)
#   python scripts/gen models/bracket.step.py --write
#   python scripts/export models/bracket.step.py --stl --3mf

# after (0.5)
from cadgen import build123d as bd
from cadgen import glb, step, stl, threemf


@step(out="../STEP/bracket.step")
@stl(out="../STL/bracket.stl")
@threemf
@glb
def bracket():
    return bd.Box(40, 20, 6)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    bracket()
```

- The 3MF decorator is spelled `@threemf` (identifiers cannot start with a
  digit); the CLI door is `3mf`.
- Stacking order is behaviour-neutral.
- Bare (`@glb`) means the sibling default. Declare the same format more than
  once at *distinct* `out=` targets for draft/print variants; two bare
  declarations of one format collide, as do two identical `out=` targets.
- `@stl`/`@glb`/`@threemf` accept `out=`, `mesh_tolerance=`,
  `mesh_angular_tolerance=` and their own `kinematics=`.
- Mesh decorators on a `@dxf` drawing are an error.
- **A model needs no `@step` at all.** `@stl`/`@glb`/`@threemf` alone make a
  **mesh-only model**: same tree, same record, same freshness; its outputs are
  the meshes. A model's outputs are exactly what its decorators declare.

`python bracket.py` writes every declared output and heals any that were
deleted. No separate export step.

#### Running the model

```bash
python bracket.py
```

Flags ride the script's argv:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--force` | Rebuild even when the gate says current. |
| `--mesh-tolerance FLOAT` | Override chord tolerance for this run. |
| `--mesh-angular-tolerance FLOAT` | Override angular tolerance, radians. |
| `--verbose` | Stage timing and full tracebacks on stderr. |
| `--json` | One JSON result line on stdout. |

There is no `-o`, no `--write`, no `--lock-timeout`.

What a run says: **stdout** carries one result line — `built STEP/bracket.step`
or `current STEP/bracket.step` (a mesh-only model prints its tree hash; a
drawing prints its `.dxf`). With `--json` that line carries `outcome`
(`built` | `current`), `document` (the written STEP's path, `null` for a
mesh-only model) and `tree` (the result's hash in the store). `packagePath` is
gone. **stderr** carries the build tree — every model
the run touched, collapsing as each finishes — and the `[cadgen] wrote ...`
lines.

Behaviours that differ from v0.4 and will bite:

- **A run always writes its outputs.** There is no `--write`, and no way to
  build "just the tree": running the model produces the files.
- **Importing a model module never builds.** Only the call does. Inside another
  model's body, a call composes (next step); at top level, it builds.
- **Every build is parallel.** Children build on a pool of warm workers; a
  build never waits on or cancels another build, and two runs of the same model
  can overlap — the store's publish rule decides what lands.

### 3. Convert composition: children are models you call

In v0.4 an assembly built its parts inline, through `lib/` helpers, or with
`cadgen.compose.memo`. In v0.5 **a child is a model**: a sibling file with its
own decorator and outputs. The parent imports it and **calls** it:

```python
# frame.py
from cadgen import build123d as bd
from cadgen import step

from plate import plate          # importing links; never builds
from standoff import standoff


@step(out="../STEP/frame.step")
def frame():
    p = plate()                                  # submits plate's build, returns at once
    left = bd.Pos(-30, 0, 5) * standoff()        # placements are deferred too
    right = bd.Pos(30, 0, 5) * standoff()        # a second call: same result, one build
    return bd.Compound(children=[p, left, right], label="frame")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    frame()
```

- **`compose.memo` is deleted.** `cadgen.compose` does not exist. Every
  `memo(helper, ...)` call site becomes a model file for that child, imported
  and called. The cache it provided is the store: a current child is served
  from its tree in milliseconds.
- **Calls are lazy and parallel.** Inside a body a call submits the child's
  build to the pool and returns a compound whose geometry is read on first use;
  `Pos * child`, `Rot * child`, `Location * child`, `.moved()`, `.label` and
  `.color` are deferred. Anything else forces it. Children therefore build in
  parallel, and the parent **links** each child's tree instead of copying its
  geometry — an intact child costs the parent no components.
- **Place with `Pos/Rot/Location *` or `.moved(loc)`, never `.located(loc)`.**
  `located()` deep-copies the geometry, which turns a link into the parent's
  own components (still correct, just no longer shared).
- **A rebuilt part does not update its assemblies until they are rebuilt.**
  `python src/plate.py` publishes plate's new tree; `frame` still pins the old
  one and reads as stale until `python src/frame.py` runs. Pull semantics.
  `cadgen store why src/frame.py` shows the pinned-vs-current pair.
- **Models by result, constants by value, functions by file.** Importing a
  sibling's *model* is a result edge (its tree hash); importing a *constant*
  from a model file is tracked by value; importing a *function* or any name
  from a non-model file (`lib/`) puts that file in the closure — any edit
  rebuilds. Shared constants can live in a model file or in `lib/`.
- **Mirrored parts are their own model.** STEP cannot express a reflection, so
  a right-hand part built by mirroring a left-hand model becomes the parent's
  own geometry. Write a factory in `lib/` and two one-line models:

  ```python
  # lib/bracket_shape.py                 # bracket_left.py            # bracket_right.py
  def build(side: str):                  @step(out="../STEP/bracket_left.step")
      sign = 1 if side == "left" else -1 def bracket_left():
      ...                                    return bracket_shape.build("left")
  ```

- **Sub-assemblies are models** with their own file and outputs; a
  `lib/*.build()` helper that assembled a system becomes `src/<system>.py`.
- **Sidecar boundary.** A child's kinematics and mesh declarations belong to
  that child alone. A parent receives geometry (tree, labels, colors,
  placements) and nothing else; **mates never propagate up**. The v0.4
  `assembly_mates` promotion plumbing is deleted, and so is
  `AssemblyHelper.relations`.
- **Dynamic imports** (`__import__`, `importlib`, and loading a sibling model
  file by path with `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`) of model modules
  are not tracked. Import children explicitly. Two v0.4 habits hide here: a
  script that loaded a sibling model file **to read one constant** becomes
  `from sibling import CONSTANT` (tracked by value); a script that loaded a
  sibling model module **to rebuild it under different constants** (re-exec,
  environment variables, monkeypatched globals) becomes a factory in `lib/`
  that takes those values as arguments, called by two ordinary models.
- **The environment is not an input.** Model and `lib/` code reads no
  parameter from `os.environ`, the working directory, the current time or a
  random source: the gate tracks source by hash, constants by value and children by
  result, and cannot see any of those, so a value that changes geometry
  through them leaves a stale result reading as current. A configuration is a
  factory argument; another configuration is another model.

### 4. Move articulation to kinematics + the render module (`<name>.step.js`)

v0.4's `.params.js` sidecar — FK scripts, pose functions, demo modes — is gone,
and so is GIF export. v0.5 splits what `.params.js` conflated into three
systems with different lifecycles:

| System | Where it lives | Lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Geometry | The model function's body and the factories it calls | Changing one rebuilds the model |
| Kinematics | `kinematics=` on the decorator, pure data | Drives viewer sliders and posed exports; a kinematics edit rewrites the sidecar, never the geometry |
| Animation | `STEP/<name>.step.js`, a plain ES module beside the document | Loaded by the viewer by name; no build reads it — an edit is a reload |

A note on the name: v0.4 also had a `<name>.step.js`, the JS *declarations
sidecar*. That file and that meaning are gone. In v0.5 `<name>.step.js` is the
**render module**: authored JavaScript the renderer loads beside the document
(today: animation clips). Delete every v0.4 `.step.js` before creating one.

#### Typed mates

One dict, closed key vocabulary `mates` / `couplings` / `poses` / `at`:

```python
import cadgen
from cadgen import build123d as bd
from cadgen import step

KINEMATICS = {
    "mates": [
        cadgen.revolute("elbow", parent="#upper_arm", child="#forearm",
                        axis="#forearm.pivot_bore", limits=(0, 150)),
        cadgen.slider("extend", parent="#rail", child="#carriage",
                      axis="#rail.f2", limits=(0, 80)),
        cadgen.cylindrical("lead", parent="#housing", child="#screw",
                           axis="#screw.f1",
                           limits={"turn": (0, 3600), "travel": (0, 40)}),
        cadgen.fastened("mount", parent="#carriage", child="#bracket"),
    ],
    "couplings": [cadgen.couple("curl", {"mcp": 50, "pip": 70, "dip": 40})],
    "poses": {"open": {"jaw": 40}, "closed": {"jaw": 0}},
}


@step(out="../STEP/arm.step", kinematics=KINEMATICS)
def arm(): ...
```

Rules that catch v0.4 conversions:

- **Authored placement is q=0.** Every DOF's rest value is 0 — the placement
  you built. There is no `default=` on a mate; passing one is an error. A
  presentation pose is a `poses` preset.
- **Mate kinds** are `revolute` (degrees), `slider` (model units),
  `cylindrical` (sub-DOFs `<name>.turn` and `<name>.travel` about one axis),
  and `fastened` (0-DOF rigid attachment). `fastened` is needed exactly when
  occurrences are *siblings* in the instance tree — a pin that must orbit with
  its carrier. Instance-tree children ride for free.
- **`fastened` mates contribute no DOF.** They take no `limits` and no axis.
- **Limits are required** on every non-`fastened` mate: `(lo, hi)` for
  single-DOF kinds, a `{"turn": ..., "travel": ...}` dict for `cylindrical`.
- **`parent`/`child` are occurrence refs** — `#`-prefixed labels (canonical;
  label parts with `cadgen.label_shape`) or occurrence ids. A ref may name a
  subassembly, which carries every part beneath it.
- **`axis`** is a selector ref (`axis="#forearm.pivot_bore"`) *or* literals
  (`origin=(x,y,z), direction=(x,y,z)`) — never both. Refs resolve once at
  build into world numbers; the viewer does arithmetic, never topology.
- **The mate graph is a tree**: one parent mate per occurrence, no cycles.
  Closed-loop linkages are out of scope by design.
- **Couplings gear real mate DOFs**, not other couplings. No chaining.
- **`pose=` does not exist, and neither does a bake point.** v0.5 briefly had
  an `"at"` key in the kinematics dict that wrote the artifact transformed to a
  pose; it is deleted. No decorator argument changes geometry: a model that
  must be written at a configuration is authored there, or is another model.
  Presets stay for the viewer and `snapshot --kinematics`.
- **Mates stay with the model that declares them.** A parent that links an
  articulated child gets its geometry, not its mates (step 3).

#### The render module: `STEP/<name>.step.js`

Choreography moves out of Python entirely — and out of the build. It is a plain
ES module beside the **document** (not the script), named after it:

```js
// STEP/arm.step.js — beside STEP/arm.step
export const clips = {
  demo: {
    label: "Demo",
    duration: 8,          // seconds
    loop: true,           // default
    update(t, m) {        // called every frame; t in seconds
      m.get("forearm").rotate([0, 0, 1], 120 * (t / 8), [0, 0, 25]);
      m.get("#o1.3.1,o1.3.2").translate([0, 0, 40 * Math.min(t / 2, 1)]);
      m.get("lid").opacity(t < 5 ? 1 : 1 - (t - 5) / 2);
    },
  },
};
```

- `m.get(target)` takes a label (canonical) or occurrence-id refs, comma-listed;
  each id covers its whole subtree. Unknown targets **throw** — a typo never
  silently animates nothing.
- Handles: `.rotate(axis, degrees, origin=[0,0,0])`, `.translate(vec)`,
  `.opacity(0..1)`, `.visible(bool)`. Successive transforms **premultiply**.
- Every frame starts from rest and `update(t)` rebuilds the state — a pure
  function of `t`, so scrub, loop and seek are free. No wall-clock, no state.
- Animation is deliberately ignorant of mates. That independence is what
  guarantees a choreography edit can never invalidate a build.
- Nothing declares the file and no build reads it: drop it beside the
  document and the viewer's Animation tab appears; the only export the
  renderer understands today is `clips`, and an export it does not know is a
  load error shown in the Status tab. Targets are checked at load against
  the compiled tree.
- It is **authored**, so it is **committed**: the project `.gitignore`
  whitelists it (`!/STEP/*.step.js`, step 5).
- Coming from a v0.4 `.params.js` demo mode or an early-0.5 `.anim.js`: move
  the file to `STEP/<name>.step.js`, keep the `clips` export, and delete the
  `animation=` argument — it is an unknown argument now.

**GIF export is deleted.** Snapshot writes PNG stills only, and a `.gif` output
path is refused. Motion review is interactive in the CAD Viewer. For still
evidence of a configuration, render at DOF values:

```bash
cadgen step snapshot STEP/arm.step tmp/open.png --kinematics '{"jaw": 40}'
cadgen step snapshot STEP/arm.step tmp/open.png --kinematics open   # a declared preset
```

#### Annotating a STEP you did not generate

A document with no model script gets kinematics from `cadgen step build IN OUT`,
whose `--kinematics` takes the whole space as inline JSON or a `.json` path.
`OUT` is required and is never `IN`. Choreography needs no verb: put
`OUT.js` beside `OUT` (`STEP/vendor.step.js` beside `STEP/vendor.step`). To make an import a first-class model instead, wrap
it: a `@step` whose body is `return read_step(...)` gives the vendor file a
record, a tree and a place in your assemblies.

### 5. Reshape the project layout, then delete v0.4 leftovers

v0.5 is unopinionated in *code* — `out=` puts an artifact anywhere. The
convention below is what the tooling's examples assume.

```
<project>/
  src/                    # authored code — the only thing you edit
    README.md             #   model catalog
    plate.py              #   one model per file
    plate_drawing.py
    frame.py              #   an assembly: calls plate() and standoff()
    lib/
      __init__.py         #   a regular package, never a namespace one
      holes.py            #   helpers, factories, shared constants
  STEP/                   # raw outputs only (plus source sidecars) — and the render module
    plate.step
    plate.step.json
    plate.step.js         #   choreography beside its document: authored, committed
    imported/             #   vendor files keep their upstream names
  DXF/  STL/  GLB/  3MF/  # same shape: outputs + imported/
  tmp/                    # scratch
```

- **`imported/` is a subfolder of each format folder**, not a top-level
  directory.
- **Every `.py` directly under `src/` is a model.** Shared code goes in
  `src/lib/`. So `ls src/*.py` is the catalog. A model may share its stem with
  the `lib/` module it wraps — alias the import.
- **Model script stem = artifact stem = a Python identifier.** Part numbers,
  revisions and spaces go on the artifact via `out=`, never in the stem.
- **Build a project with a per-script loop.** There is no Makefile, no
  directory sweep and no `cadgen build`: `for m in src/*.py; do python $m;
  done`, or run the root assembly, which pulls everything beneath it.

**Commit policy.** Authored `src/` is always committed. Format folders are not,
with two deliberate exceptions: `imported/` sources, and pinned byte-for-byte
fixtures (`git add -f`).

```gitignore
/STEP/*
!/STEP/imported/
/DXF/*
!/DXF/imported/
/STL/*
!/STL/imported/
/GLB/*
!/GLB/imported/
/3MF/*
!/3MF/imported/
/tmp/
__pycache__/
```

The `*` forms are load-bearing. Ignoring `/STEP/` outright would make the
`imported/` negation dead, because git never descends into an ignored directory.

**Now delete the v0.4 leftovers — before debugging anything.** Stale droppings
produce failures that point at the wrong thing.

1. **In-tree package directories.** v0.4 kept render packages beside the
   sources in a per-folder `__cadgen__/models/<entry>/` directory. v0.5 keeps
   nothing in the tree:

   ```bash
   find . -type d -name __cadgen__ -prune -print   # look first
   find . -type d -name __cadgen__ -prune -exec rm -rf {} +
   ```

2. **v0.4 sidecars.** Delete `<name>.step.js` / `<name>.stp.js` step-module
   sidecars, every `<name>.params.js`, and any `<name>.step.source.json` left
   over from an intermediate 0.5 snapshot. v0.5 writes exactly one sidecar
   shape, `<name>.step.json` at schema 5, and refuses anything else at that
   name (see the schema section below).

3. **The old cache.** v0.4's `~/.cache/cadgen` layout (`packages/`,
   `components/`, `opmemo/`, `records/`) is simply abandoned — nothing reads it
   and nothing migrates it. Delete the directory; v0.5 creates its store on the
   first build:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cache/cadgen          # or $CADGEN_CACHE_DIR if you set one
   ```

   Clearing the store is always safe, in any version: every model reads as
   stale and rebuilds; no project file is touched.

Also delete the **generated STEP/mesh files themselves** if you want a clean
comparison. A v0.4-generated `.step` has cadgen provenance properties embedded
*inside* the STEP text — v0.5 writes none, so an old artifact is never
byte-comparable with a new one even when the geometry is identical.

### 6. Rebuild

```bash
python src/plate.py
python src/frame.py        # builds plate and standoff too, in parallel, then links them
```

Run each model script explicitly, or the roots. A second run of a current model
prints `current ...` and never touches the kernel.

#### Rethink your tolerance flags — do not copy them

This is the easiest thing to get silently wrong.

| | v0.4 | v0.5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--mesh-tolerance` | **absolute** linear deflection, mm; default `0.02` | **relative** chord tolerance, fraction of each component's bounding diagonal; default `1.5e-3` |
| `--mesh-angular-tolerance` | radians; default `0.6` | radians; default `0.35` |

A v0.4 value carried over unchanged means something entirely different. On a
200 mm part, `--mesh-tolerance 0.02` used to mean 0.02 mm; in v0.5 it means
0.02 × 200 = 4 mm — vastly coarser. Drop your old numbers and start from the
new defaults, tightening only where a curved part visibly needs it. Tolerances
declared on a root do not reach its children; declare them on every model that
needs them.

There is now **one** JS tessellator for both render and export; the OCCT mesh
path is deleted. An exported STL/3MF/GLB is the same tessellation the viewer
draws, watertight, colored, and byte-deterministic across repeated exports.

#### The daemon and the pool

Every build runs on a pool of warm worker processes, one bound per model. The
job limit follows the platform's native-worker policy: Windows defaults to at
most four and reduces further under memory pressure (`CADGEN_JOBS` overrides).
You start nothing — the
first call spawns the daemon. `cadgen daemon status` shows its workers and the
jobs in flight. There are **no locks**: `--lock-timeout`, "contended" and
"skipped" outcomes are gone; a build never waits on another and never cancels
one. `CADGEN_DAEMON=0` runs the same parallel build on transient workers that
exit with the run (useful for tests; those builds are invisible to a running
viewer). Do not mix the two modes on one model.

### 7. Verify

**Freshness.** `cadgen store why <model.py>` is the one freshness door. It
prints the gate's verdict clause by clause and why — which closure file
changed, which child's result moved, which output is missing — and exits 1
when stale. Reach for it whenever a model did or did not rebuild when you
expected, before reaching for `--force`.

```bash
cadgen store why src/frame.py
cadgen store info                # what the store holds, by kind
cadgen store forget src/frame.py # drop one model's record; the next run rebuilds it
cadgen store forget STEP/frame.step  # drop one document's tree entry; the next open recompiles it
cadgen store gc --dry-run        # what a sweep would remove
```

**Inspect.** The baseline check, then targeted questions:

```bash
cadgen step inspect refs STEP/plate.step --facts --planes --positioning
cadgen step inspect validate STEP/plate.step
cadgen step inspect measure STEP/frame.step --from '#o1.2' --to '#o1.3' --axis x
```

`refs --facts` reports counts and bounds, and its `ok` field covers ref
resolution only — an open shell and an inverted solid both pass it. Use
`validate` for geometry soundness.

**Snapshot.** Mandatory after any visible change:

```bash
cadgen step snapshot STEP/plate.step tmp/review.png
```

The path you name is the path you get, cleared before the render and written
atomically after it, so a missing file is the failure signal.

**Verify the geometry did not move.** Compare `inspect refs --facts` of the
v0.4 build you kept with the new one: identical occurrence, face and edge
counts and bounds mean the migration moved nothing. Between two v0.5 builds the
check is sharper — `python src/plate.py --json` prints the `tree` hash, and an
identical tree is identical geometry.

**View.** The CAD Viewer is `cadgen viewer`, run from the directory to serve:

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/project && cadgen viewer
cadgen viewer list      # every running viewer and what it serves
cadgen viewer stop --port 3245
```

The client build ships in the wheel; there is no separate viewer install or
launcher. A document's badge shows compile state only — **not compiled**,
**compiling**, **rendered**, **failed** — and a document with no tree is
compiled when you open it. The viewer never reads your source and never says
"stale": whether a document is behind its script is `store why`'s question.

---

## CLI cross-reference

v0.4's user-facing commands were skill scripts run as `python scripts/<tool>`.
v0.5 has a single console script, `cadgen`, plus running model scripts
directly. Every subcommand is also reachable as `python -m cadgen.cli <verb>`.

| v0.4 | v0.5 |
| --- | --- |
| `python scripts/gen MODEL.step.py` | `python model.py` |
| `python scripts/gen MODEL.step.py --write` | `python model.py` (a run always writes) |
| `python scripts/gen ... --write PATH` | `out=` on the decorator (there is no per-run override) |
| `python scripts/gen ... --force` | `python model.py --force` |
| `python scripts/gen ... --json` / `--verbose` | `python model.py --json` / `--verbose` |
| `python scripts/gen ... --mesh-tolerance` | same flag — **but the units changed**, see step 6 |
| `python scripts/export TARGET --stl/--3mf/--glb` | `@stl`/`@threemf`/`@glb` on the model, or `cadgen stl\|3mf\|glb build DOC [OUT]` |
| `cadgen.compose.memo(helper, ...)` | a child model, imported and called |
| `python scripts/inspect refs\|measure\|align\|frame\|diff\|validate` | `cadgen step inspect <inspection> ...` |
| `python scripts/snapshot ...` | `cadgen step snapshot`, `cadgen stl\|3mf\|glb snapshot`, `cadgen dxf snapshot`, `cadgen urdf\|sdf snapshot`, or polymorphic `cadgen snapshot` |
| `python scripts/artifact ...` / `cadgen-step-artifact` | `cadgen step compile` (internal; every door compiles on demand) |
| `python skills/cad/scripts/cadgen_daemon ...` | `cadgen daemon status` |
| the viewer launcher (`npm run start --dir`, `server/main.py`) | `cadgen viewer`, `cadgen viewer list`, `cadgen viewer stop` |
| `cadgen cache info\|gc` (intermediate 0.5) | `cadgen store info\|why\|forget\|gc` |
| DXF: `python skills/dxf/scripts/gen ...` | `python drawing.py` |
| — | `cadgen step build IN OUT` (re-emit/annotate a document) |
| — | `cadgen store why <model.py>` |
| — | `cadgen doctor` |

The full v0.5 command set is `cadgen --help`:

```
3mf|glb|stl build      write a model's mesh output(s)
3mf|glb|stl snapshot   render a mesh to an image
daemon status          show the warm daemon's workers
doctor                 print installed cadgen and verify a skill's pin
dxf snapshot           render a DXF to an image
sdf|urdf snapshot      render a robot description to an image
sdf|urdf|srdf validate validate a robot description
snapshot               render any supported input to an image
step build             write a new STEP from one, with kinematics
step compile           make a STEP's tree current (internal)
step inspect           inspect selector references in a STEP
step snapshot          render a STEP model to an image
store                  the store: info, why <model> (gate verdict), forget <target>, gc
viewer [list|stop]     serve the current directory in the CAD Viewer
```

Notable absences: there is no `cadgen gen`, no `cadgen export`, no `cadgen
build`, and no `cadgen dxf build` — a drawing's file *is* the product, made by
running its script.

### Doors take documents; scripts are run

Every `cadgen` verb above takes a `.step` / `.stl` / `.dxf` **file** — a
document. `python <script>` is the only source door. A door finds a document's
tree by the hash of the file's bytes; when there is none (a vendor STEP, a file
copied in from elsewhere, a store you just cleared) it **compiles the file** as
a pool job and proceeds. A door never refuses a document and never runs a
script: it does not know, or ask, whether the file is behind its source. That
question belongs to `cadgen store why`.

## Selector refs

**Good news: the ref grammar only widened.** No ref a v0.4 project wrote stops
parsing in v0.5. You do not have to rewrite refs — this section is here so you
know what is now *available*.

A ref is one token: `[<file-prefix>]#<selector>[,<selector>...]`. No spaces —
the token stops at whitespace.

| Form | Spelling |
| --- | --- |
| Occurrence | `#o1`, `#o1.2`, `#o1.2.3` |
| Occurrence + entity | `#o1.12.f19`, `#o1.2.e7`, `#o1.2.s3`, `#o1.2.v4` |
| Bare entity | `#f45`, `#e12`, `#s2`, `#v4` (single-occurrence documents, or inheriting context in a comma list) |
| Label | `#eye_shank`, `#mounting_eye:lower` |
| Label + entity | `#servo_end_plate.f45` |
| Numbered alias for a duplicate label | `#cast_rim:5spoke_1`, `#cast_rim:5spoke_2` |
| Mate | `#m1` |
| Whole file | `mounting_plate.stl#` |

Entity kinds are exactly `s` (shape), `f` (face), `e` (edge), `v` (vertex).

> A label ref is `#<the build123d part name>.<kind><n>` — the literal word
> `label` never appears. `#servo_end_plate.f45` names face 45 of the part
> labelled `servo_end_plate`.

- **Comma lists inherit context.** Whichever naming scheme came last seeds the
  bare entities after it: `#o1.2,f3,f4` means `o1.2`, `o1.2.f3`, `o1.2.f4`.
- **Duplicate labels never resolve bare.** A label matching two occurrences
  raises and lists the numbered aliases (`_1`, `_2`, in occurrence-tree order).
- **Numeric forms win.** A part named `f12` or `o1.4` gets no alias and is
  reachable only by its numeric id.
- **Occurrence-group refs have no special syntax.** A group is an occurrence
  ref naming an interior node of the instance tree — `#o1.4`. In v0.4 that was
  an error; in v0.5 it expands to its subtree leaves in tree order.

**File prefixes are a guard, not a resolver.** An empty prefix (`#o1.2`) is
accepted everywhere. A *non-empty* prefix must name the file the command was
already pointed at, or it is an error; it never selects a different file.

```bash
cadgen step inspect refs STEP/bracket.step '#o1.2.f19'      # always fine
cadgen step inspect refs STEP/bracket.step 'bracket#o1.2'   # fine: names the target
cadgen step inspect refs STEP/bracket.step 'other#o1.2'     # error
```

**What is emitted.** The toolchain accepts many spellings and prints exactly
one: numeric, leading `#`, no file prefix. On a single-occurrence document the
occurrence prefix is dropped from the display form (`#f45`), while an assembly
prints the full path (`#o1.12.f19`). The CAD Viewer is the one place that emits
file-prefixed refs.

**Surfaces differ slightly.** `inspect refs`/`frame`/`measure`/`align` require
the leading `#`; `inspect validate`/`interfere --refs` and snapshot's
`--focus`/`--hide` accept it optionally. `inspect diff` takes no refs at all.
Snapshot selection accepts **occurrence refs only**.

**Stop writing `.step.py` targets.** `path/to/entry.step.py` was a documented
target form in v0.4 and is no longer part of the contract.

## Snapshot job schema

If your v0.4 project drove snapshots from job JSON, the schema changed.

**Top-level `focus`, `hide` and `refs` are retired.** They live inside a nested
`selection` object now:

```json
// before (0.4)                    // after (0.5)
{ "input": "arm.step",             { "input": "arm.step",
  "focus": ["#o1.2"],                "selection": { "focus": ["#o1.2"] },
  "params": { "jaw": 40 },           "kinematics": { "jaw": 40 },
  "outputs": ["out.png"] }           "outputs": ["out.png"] }
```

The accepted job keys are: `input` (required), `mode`, `outputs`, `theme`,
`display`, `render`, `camera`, `selection`, `kinematics`, `animation`
(`{"clip": name, "time": seconds}` — one still frame of a STEP model's clip,
layered over `kinematics`), `jointValues`, `sizeProfile`, `width`, `height`,
`scale`, `sceneScale`, `debug`, `timeoutSeconds`.

Also removed: the `params` key (it is `kinematics` now), and `workspaceRoot` /
`rootDir` (pass a relative or absolute `input` path instead). `.gif` output
paths are refused.

- `mode` is `view` (default), `section` or `list`. Mesh inputs allow only
  `view` and `list`.
- `selection.focus`/`selection.refs` and `selection.hide` are mutually
  exclusive within one job. Selection requires STEP topology, so mesh, robot
  and DXF inputs refuse it.
- `outputs` entries are a bare string or an object with `path`, `width`,
  `height`, `sizeProfile`, `camera`, `label`, `viewLabel`, `dataUrl`, `text`.
- A packet may be a single job object, a bare array of jobs, or
  `{"jobs": [...]}`.
- `--job PATH` reads a JSON file; `--job -` reads stdin. The rich option flags
  (`--camera`, `--theme`, `--display`, `--kinematics`, `--animation`) each
  take a name, inline JSON, or a path; `--time SECONDS` is the moment for
  `--animation` and is refused without it.

### Themes and display are two separate options

- **`--theme`** selects the visual world: `materials`, `background`, `floor`,
  `environment`, `lighting`, `colorMode`, `projection`, `modeColors`. Ids:
  `workbench-light`, `workbench-dark`, `cinematic`, `vibrant`, `blue`, `pink`,
  `clay-sunrise`, `terminal`, plus the render-only `snapshot`.
- **`--display`** controls how geometry is drawn: `projection`, `mode`, `clip`,
  `exploded`, `edges`.

The snapshot default theme is `snapshot` — Workbench Light with the ground grid
and origin axis removed. Pass `--theme workbench-light` for the viewer's own
look. Display `mode` has seven canonical values: `solid`, `rendered`,
`transparent`, `hidden_edges`, `hidden_lines_removed`, `unshaded`,
`wireframe`; the two topology modes need CAD topology, so mesh inputs refuse
them.

## Artifact and schema reference

### What lands where

| Thing | v0.4 | v0.5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model source | `<name>.step.py` / `<name>.dxf.py` with `gen_step()`/`gen_dxf()` | `<name>.py` with one parameterless decorated function, called under `__main__` |
| Primary artifact | Written only with `--write` | Whatever the decorators declare, always written by a run; STEP is not required |
| Derived geometry | In-tree `__cadgen__/models/<entry>/` render packages | `~/.cache/cadgen/objects/` — content-addressed components and trees |
| Freshness | Provenance embedded in the STEP text, later a `records/` tier | `~/.cache/cadgen/index/model/<sha256(script path)>` — the model's record |
| Children | Inline geometry, `lib/` helpers, `compose.memo` | Sibling models, called; the parent's tree **links** their trees |
| Declarations sidecar | `<name>.step.js` (a JS module) | `<name>.step.json`, schema 6, JSON |
| Pose/FK script | `<name>.params.js` | `kinematics=` on the decorator (data, in the sidecar) |
| Animation | `.params.js` demo modes; GIF export | `<name>.step.js` beside the document — the render module, loaded by the viewer, read by no build; PNG stills only |
| Mesh outputs | `scripts/export --stl/--3mf/--glb` | `@stl`/`@threemf`/`@glb` decorators, or the format doors |

### The sidecar: `<name>.step.json`, schema 6

A sidecar carries **declarations only**, and exists **only when strictly
necessary** — today, when the model declares kinematics. A model that declares
none writes no sidecar at all, and a rebuild of a model that dropped its
kinematics deletes the stale one. What a model declares about its outputs
(`@stl`/`@glb`/`@threemf`) lives in its store record; the `meshExports`
section that once copied it beside the STEP is gone (a mesh door tessellates
the document's tree and writes the file it was asked for, no lookup).
Choreography is not in it either: that is the render module beside the
document (`<name>.step.js`, step 4).

```
schemaVersion   6
kinematics      typed mates with axes resolved to world numbers, couplings, pose presets
```

There is **no** `sourceKind`, `sourcePath`, `sourceHash`, `sourceClosure`, or
timestamp — a generated file carries no tie back to its source. A model that
*drops* its kinematics loses the file. A sidecar belongs to the model that
declares it: a parent's sidecar never carries a child's mates.

**A v0.4 sidecar is not read.** A sidecar that is present must declare schema 5;
anything else is an error naming the schema found and the fix — rebuild the
model, or re-annotate the document with `cadgen step build`. A *missing*
sidecar is fine. The migration for sidecars is exactly: **delete the old ones
and rebuild from source.**

### The store

Everything derived lives in one root — `$CADGEN_CACHE_DIR` if set, else the
platform cache dir (`~/.cache/cadgen` on Linux and macOS) — with two sides:

```
objects/ab/cdef…                    immutable, content-addressed: components and trees
index/document/<sha256(file bytes)> a file's bytes → its tree (what every door reads)
index/model/<sha256(script path)>   the model's record: tree, closure, children pins, outputs
index/output/<sha256(output path)>  which script wrote the file at this path
index/component | op | mesh         component entries, the op memo, tessellations
```

`objects/` and `index/document` are the **artifact side**: no object references
a source file, and a reader (door, viewer, snapshot) never opens a record.
`index/model` and friends are the **code side**: what source produced what and
what it depended on. Records are deletable without corrupting anything; a
rebuild re-creates them. `cadgen store info` sizes it, `cadgen store forget`
drops one model's record or one document's tree entry, `cadgen store gc`
sweeps unreachable objects, and deleting the whole root is always safe. Nothing
else is written anywhere — a build's progress is process state, read from the
daemon.

## Troubleshooting a half-migrated project

Remember: these errors describe the v0.5 contract. None of them will mention
0.4.

**"declares no CAD model" / "decorate one function with `@step` or `@dxf`"**
You ran a file that still has a bare `gen_step()`/`gen_dxf()` function, or you
renamed the file but forgot the decorator. → Step 2.

**Running the script prints nothing and writes nothing**
The file has no `if __name__ == "__main__": model()`. Decorating declares; the
call builds. → Step 2.

**"takes no parameters"**
A converted `gen_step()` kept parameters — with or without defaults. A model
takes no arguments; parametric geometry is a factory the model calls, another
configuration is another model. → Step 2, and "Mirrored parts" in step 3.

**"takes no arguments"** at a call site
Something calls a model with arguments. Models are called bare; the factory
takes the arguments. → Step 3.

**A dict came back from the model / "bare shape"**
The v0.4 envelope. Return the shape; declare meshes as decorators. → Step 2.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: cadgen.compose`**
`memo` is gone. Each memoized helper becomes a child model, imported and
called. → Step 3.

**`AttributeError: ... has no attribute 'relations'` / `assembly_mates`**
The mates-promotion plumbing is deleted; a parent never receives a child's
mates. Declare the mates on the model that owns the parts, or on the parent for
its own occurrences. → Step 3.

**"unsupported sidecar schema … (expected 5)"**
A v0.4 sidecar (or an intermediate `.step.source.json`) is still sitting next to
the artifact. → Delete it and rebuild. Step 5.

**Unexpected keyword argument on a decorator, or "out= must be a non-empty path string"**
You passed a retired name — `write=` instead of `out=`, `pose=`, `animation=`
on any decorator (choreography is the render module beside the document),
`kinematics=` on `@dxf` — or a value of the wrong kind. → The decorator table
in step 2.

**"kinematics has unknown key(s) … the vocabulary is closed"**
Your kinematics dict has something other than `mates`, `couplings`, `poses`
(`at`, the deleted bake point, is one). → Step 4.

**Unrecognized argument `-o` / `--output` / `--lock-timeout` on a model run**
There is no per-run output override and no lock layer. `out=` on the decorator
places the file. → Step 2.

**Unrecognized argument on a `cadgen` command**
A retired snapshot flag. `--input`/`-i` and `--output`/`-o` became the two
positionals `TARGET OUT`; `--params` became `--kinematics`. → `cadgen <verb>
--help` is always the current interface.

**`cadgen cache` is not a command**
The intermediate 0.5 name. → `cadgen store info|why|forget|gc`.

**A model did not rebuild after I edited a child**
Expected: a parent pulls its children only when it is built. `cadgen store why
<parent.py>` shows the child pinned at the old tree. → Rebuild the parent.

**An assembly copied a part's geometry instead of linking it**
The part was reflected, `located()`, or otherwise modified after the call.
→ Place with `Pos/Rot/Location *` or `.moved()`; make a mirrored part its own
model. Step 3.

**Mesh export fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND 'three'`** (source checkouts only)
The checkout's `packages/cadgen-js/node_modules` is missing; cadgen names the
fix. Installed wheels never see this.

**Meshes came out far coarser (or finer) than in v0.4**
You carried a tolerance number across. `--mesh-tolerance` is relative now.
→ Step 6.

**The viewer shows a document as "not compiled" after a build**
The build ran with `CADGEN_DAEMON=0`, which the viewer cannot see, or the
viewer was opened on a different store root. Open the file: the viewer compiles
it from its bytes.

## Migration complete when

- [ ] Every model is a parameterless decorated function in a plain `.py`,
      called under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
- [ ] No `gen_step`/`gen_dxf` remains; no `.step.py`/`.dxf.py` filenames
      remain; no `compose.memo`, `-o`, or envelope dict remains.
- [ ] All build123d access goes through `from cadgen import build123d as bd`.
- [ ] All vendor STEP reads go through `cadgen.read_step`.
- [ ] Every assembly imports and calls its part models; mirrored parts are their
      own models; placement uses `Pos/Rot/Location *` or `.moved()`.
- [ ] No `__cadgen__` directory, `.step.js`, `.params.js`, or
      `.step.source.json` remains anywhere in the project; the old cache root
      is gone.
- [ ] Every model script runs clean, a second run prints `current`, and
      `cadgen store why` agrees.
- [ ] `cadgen step inspect validate` passes on each STEP you author. Purchased
      and vendor solids brought in with `read_step` are inputs, not your
      geometry: validate them once to know what you have, and expect an
      assembly that contains them to report their defects, not yours.
- [ ] A snapshot of each primary STEP has been rendered and reviewed.
- [ ] Tolerance flags have been re-derived from the new relative defaults, not
      copied.
