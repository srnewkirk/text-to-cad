# AGENTS.md

This repo is a workbench for CAD-related agent skills. Treat `skills/` as the
product and `models/` as the shared fixture/artifact area.

## Fork-Only Authorization Boundary

- This checkout is maintained for `srnewkirk/text-to-cad`, and local Codex
  installations must come from the `cad@homelab-plugins` package maintained in
  `srnewkirk/codex-plugin-marketplace`.
- `srnewkirk/text-to-cad` is the source-code repository. It is not the default
  plugin distribution or installation source. `srnewkirk/codex-plugin-marketplace`
  is the sole default release, distribution, registration, and installation
  authority for the personal CAD plugin.
- Treat `earthtojake/text-to-cad` and every other community repository as
  read-only reference material unless the user explicitly authorizes a specific
  external action.
- Do not open or update upstream pull requests, push upstream branches or tags,
  create upstream issues or releases, dispatch upstream workflows, or otherwise
  publish outside `srnewkirk/text-to-cad` without explicit user authorization
  naming the destination and action.
- Permission to commit, push, promote, release, or install in this project means
  the user's fork only. It never implies permission to contact or modify the
  upstream community project.
- Before beginning a code change, fetch and review the community upstream for
  relevant improvements when practical. This is a read-only comparison step:
  upstream findings may inform work in `srnewkirk/text-to-cad`, but never change
  the default write, release, distribution, or installation targets.
- Before any installation, verify and report the marketplace-qualified identity
  `cad@homelab-plugins` and the marketplace repository
  `srnewkirk/codex-plugin-marketplace`. Do not install directly from a checkout,
  worktree, symlink, community release, or upstream plugin package.

## Branch And Layout First

Before changing code, branch from `develop`, not `main`; PRs should target `develop`.
Do not start development work from `main`. The `develop` branch intentionally uses
symlinks across generated runtime and viewer-local package paths. When a path is
symlinked, follow the link and edit the source target.
Use `main` as the production clone/release branch only. `main` is publish-only:
do not open PRs to `main` or push it directly.

## Personal Release And Installation Workflow

- Do not dispatch `.github/workflows/release.yml` by default. It is inherited
  community release machinery and includes community-oriented PyPI, docs,
  mirror, tag, and GitHub Release operations. It may be inspected for useful
  implementation details but may run only when the user explicitly authorizes
  that exact workflow and its external effects.
- Normal development occurs in `srnewkirk/text-to-cad` from `develop`. Approved
  source changes are validated and incorporated into that fork's `main` by the
  personal release process.
- The installable plugin is then promoted into
  `srnewkirk/codex-plugin-marketplace` using that repository's documented,
  fail-closed promotion process. The marketplace version is the personal plugin
  release version.
- Commit and push the reviewed marketplace promotion to its `main`, then—only
  with the required explicit administrative approval—refresh the marketplace
  registration and install `cad@homelab-plugins`.
- A completed installation must contain ordinary files managed by Codex. Never
  substitute a source checkout, worktree, junction, or symlink for a marketplace
  installation.
- Community upstream review is a pre-change synchronization check, not a change
  in ownership or destination. No upstream result supersedes this workflow.

## Repo Map

- `skills/`: agent skills and their references/scripts.
- `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`: agent plugin manifests. The repository
  root is the plugin package; its skills are `skills/` directly.
- `models/`: sample and durable CAD/robot-description fixtures.
- `viewer/`: editable CAD Viewer source app.
- `packages/cadjs`: shared JS CAD/render/runtime code, UI-framework agnostic.
- `packages/implicitjs`: standalone JS implicit CAD model, shader render,
  snapshot, mesh sampling, and export runtime.
- `packages/cadgen`: shared Python STEP/GLB/topology artifact code.
- `docs/`: documentation site.
- `tests/`: root-owned test suites for skills, packages, viewer services, and
  repo-wide policy.
- `scripts/`: durable repo commands grouped by purpose.

## Repo Rules

- Keep root guidance short. Put domain workflows, CLI details, and validation
  policy in the relevant `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` or `references/` file.
- Keep relevant Markdown docs current when changing behavior, commands, or repo
  layout, but do not bloat `AGENTS.md`; use it only for durable repo-level
  rules and pointers.
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before committing, rebasing, resolving generated-file
  conflicts, or bumping release versions.
- Keep the primary local `develop` checkout in symlink layout with
  `scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh`. Do not auto-repair that layout from
  Codex or Claude Code startup hooks in linked worktrees.
- Each skill must be self-contained and independent at runtime. A skill must
  not refer to or import or depend on code from another skill, from `skills/`
  root, or from repository-root modules. Do not add `skills/`, the repository
  root, or sibling skill directories to `sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`, `NODE_PATH`,
  or similar runtime lookup paths. Shared runtime helpers must live under
  `packages/` as the source of truth and be vendored/generated from there into
  each consuming skill runtime; do not keep shared helper modules directly under
  `skills/`.
- Edit the source reached by the `develop` symlink layout first, then regenerate
  explicit derived outputs when a production-output task requires it.
- Write all test, sample, permanent, and generated CAD/robot-description
  artifacts under `models/`, including STEP/STP, STL, GLB, DXF, URDF, SRDF,
  and SDF outputs. Do not create ad hoc artifact directories elsewhere.
- Reserve `scripts/` for durable repo commands. Do not write temporary,
  one-off, or local-only helper scripts there; use `tmp/` or `/tmp` instead.
- Development symlinks mark generated or copied paths. If a file is under a
  symlinked runtime or viewer package path, edit the symlink target/source path
  instead of treating the copy as independent.
- When source changes affect generated runtimes, refresh or check them with the
  master bundle wrapper, `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`. Use lower-level bundle
  scripts only when debugging the wrapper itself.
- Never let a symlink reach the published tree. Agent installers disagree about
  symlinks and one loses data silently: the Skills CLI dereferences them, Claude
  Code preserves them, and Codex `plugin add` drops them with no error, shipping
  a skill with missing files. `scripts/github-workflows/check-builds.sh` enforces
  this; do not relax it.
- `viewer/` must stay self-contained: nothing under it may reference a path,
  command, or document above it, because it is mirrored verbatim into the
  standalone `cad-viewer` repo with no rewriting step. Keep repo-level tooling
  in `scripts/`, not under `viewer/`.
  `viewer/scripts/selfContained.test.mjs` enforces this.
- `packages/cadjs` must stay reusable/non-React; app UI and workflow state
  belong in `viewer/`.
- `packages/implicitjs` must stay reusable/non-React and independent of
  `packages/cadjs` (`implicitjs` must never import `cadjs`). The dependency
  flows one way: `cadjs` depends on `implicitjs` and re-exports its shared
  render/export APIs under `cadjs/implicit/*`, so consumers (CAD Viewer,
  snapshot tools) install and import `cadjs` alone rather than depending on
  `implicitjs` directly or duplicating implicit CAD logic. Shared primitives
  that both packages need live in `implicitjs` as the single source of truth
  and are re-exported from `cadjs` (e.g. `cadjs/common/camera.js`).
- `packages/cadgen` owns reusable Python artifact generation; skills should use
  bundled package code, not sibling skill imports.
- Create lightweight shared Python packages under `packages/` when a helper
  should not inherit heavier package dependencies.
- Use path-targeted search, validation, and `git status`; avoid broad scans over
  generated CAD/LFS artifacts unless the task requires them.
- Treat `VERSION` as the canonical release version. Do not hand-edit duplicate
  package, plugin, lockfile, or Python `pyproject.toml` versions; release
  preparation and `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh` stamp them from the canonical
  version.

## Environments

- Prefer `./.venv/bin/python` for CAD Python work.
- On Windows, production bundling requires one coherent MSYS2 environment with
  Bash and `rsync`; do not mix Git Bash with an `rsync.exe` copied from another
  POSIX runtime. Run `scripts/dev/check-windows-bundle-prereqs.ps1` before
  `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh` and invoke the bundler through the validated MSYS2
  Bash path it reports.
- Keep new branch checkouts and git worktrees lightweight by default. Do not
  copy `.venv/` or `models/` through `.worktreeinclude`; recreate `.venv/`
  inside the worktree only when Python dependencies are needed for the workflow.
- In Codex or Claude Code worktrees, prefer the skill instructions and scripts
  under the current worktree's `skills/` directory over globally installed
  skill symlinks from another checkout.
- If a worktree explicitly needs the development symlink layout, run
  `scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh --check` and then
  `scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh` intentionally in that worktree.
- Hydrate `models/` only when the user asks for it or when the task targets
  specific files under `models/`. In a new worktree, make the relevant model
  paths real before using them, preferring the local Git LFS cache with
  `git lfs checkout <path>` or `git lfs checkout models`. Download missing LFS
  objects only when explicitly requested or required after confirming the local
  cache is missing them.
- Install dependencies only for the workflow being changed.
- Do not commit `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, caches, `tmp/`, local credentials, or
  printer config.

## Checks

Run the smallest path-targeted check that covers the change. Use broad wrappers
when touching shared surfaces or before handoff:

- Code tests: `scripts/test/test.sh`
  - In GitHub Actions, `test.yml` checks the canonical release version in a
    separate job so code tests still run when version metadata is wrong; its
    test job verifies the `develop` symlink layout, checks generated outputs
    against their sources, bundles temporary production outputs, and runs docs
    and code tests against that bundle. `main` writes are validated by the
    `Release` workflow's publish job; GitHub branch settings should block PRs
    and direct pushes to `main`.
- Focused test runners: `scripts/test/test-js.sh`,
  `scripts/test/test-docs.sh`, `scripts/test/test-python.sh`,
  `scripts/test/test-global.sh`
- Development symlink layout: `scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh --check`
- Canonical release version: `scripts/release/check-version.sh`
- Generated runtime freshness: `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check`
- CAD Viewer, `packages/cadjs`, or `packages/implicitjs`:
  `npm --prefix packages/cadjs test`, `npm --prefix packages/implicitjs test`,
  `npm --prefix viewer run test`, `npm --prefix viewer run build`
- Docs site: `npm --prefix docs run check`
- Targeted Python tests: `./.venv/bin/python -m unittest <changed test paths>`

When a task intentionally writes production outputs locally, run
`scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`, rerun `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check`, and restore
the development symlink layout afterward if you are continuing on `develop`.

## CAD Viewer

A Viewer URL's PATH is the absolute directory it opens, exactly as in a `file://`
URL, and `?file=` selects one artifact within it:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3245/absolute/model/root?file=path/relative/to/that/root
```

On Windows the drive is part of that path, after the leading slash and with
forward slashes: `D:\project\models` is `.../3245/D:/project/models`.

The Viewer is not started against a directory — it opens whatever a URL names, so
one instance serves any folder **under its own served root**. That qualifier
matters in a worktree: an instance started from another checkout resolves paths
against ITS root, so an absolute path into a different clone is simply not found
and the pane reports it as outside this viewer's root. If a Viewer from another
checkout already holds the default port, start one for this workspace on a free
port (`--port <n>`) rather than pointing the running one at your path.

When reviewing repo fixtures, use the repo
`models/` directory as the path and keep permanent or generated
CAD/robot-description files there so the catalog and artifacts stay in one place.
Always use an absolute path: the Viewer runs from an arbitrary working directory,
so a relative one resolves against the wrong place. Do not stop another Viewer
unless the user asks.

Editing `viewer/` or `packages/cadjs` source and not seeing the change? Vite's
server-side transform cache can outlive both HMR and a hard reload — the browser
keeps serving the old module while the file on disk is already correct. Restart
the dev server and delete `viewer/node_modules/.vite`.

### Dev by default, prod only for e2e

Iterate with the **dev** server — Vite serves the client from source with HMR, so
your `viewer/`, `packages/cadjs`, and `packages/implicitjs` edits show up live:

```bash
npm --prefix viewer run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port <n>
# then open http://127.0.0.1:<port><repo>/models?file=<path>
```

Use the **prod** path only for end-to-end tests against the shipped bundle, or
when explicitly asked to test prod. It serves the built `dist/` via the Python
backend (the `cad-viewer` skill's `start` command), so build first:

```bash
npm --prefix viewer run build
npm --prefix viewer run start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port <n>
# then open http://127.0.0.1:<port><repo>/models?file=<path>
```

### Ports

Both `dev` and `start` listen on `--port`, defaulting to `3245`. Neither rolls to
another port: if the port is taken they exit with an error, so a Viewer is always
on the port you asked for. Pass `--port <n>` to run more than one at a time.

Packaged Viewer runtime and handoff details live in the `cad-viewer` skill.
Treat packaged Viewer checks as generated-output checks via the master bundle
wrapper unless you are debugging a lower-level script.

### Starting the Viewer from a lightweight worktree

The `cad-viewer` skill documents the PRODUCTION runtime and assumes a hydrated
checkout. In a lightweight worktree its one-liner fails four times in a row, each
with an error that does not name the real cause, because worktrees deliberately
carry no `node_modules` and no built bundle:

1. `npm --prefix skills/cad-viewer/scripts/viewer run start` dies with
   `Cannot find package 'cadjs'`. `skills/cad-viewer/scripts/viewer` is a symlink
   to `viewer/`, so the "packaged" runtime still needs the worktree's modules.
2. With those linked, the server starts and the CAD API answers but `/` returns
   404: `start` serves a prebuilt bundle and there is no `viewer/dist` yet. A live
   backend with no front end looks like a broken link, not a missing build.
3. `npm --prefix viewer run build` then fails one bare specifier at a time —
   `implicitjs`, `three`, `meshoptimizer` — each from `packages/cadjs/src/...`.
4. `meshoptimizer` is not under `packages/cadjs/node_modules` anywhere; the only
   copy in the repo is `docs/node_modules/meshoptimizer`.

From the worktree root, with `<main>` the primary checkout:

```bash
ln -s <main>/viewer/node_modules viewer/node_modules
mkdir -p packages/cadjs/node_modules
ln -s ../../implicitjs                                packages/cadjs/node_modules/implicitjs
ln -s <main>/packages/cadjs/node_modules/three        packages/cadjs/node_modules/three
ln -s <main>/docs/node_modules/meshoptimizer          packages/cadjs/node_modules/meshoptimizer
npm --prefix viewer run build
npm --prefix skills/cad-viewer/scripts/viewer run start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port <n>
```

Use an explicit free `--port`: a Viewer already running from another checkout
resolves paths against ITS root, so it will never find a model in this worktree.

Two behaviours worth knowing before you conclude a model is broken:

- **The catalog scan skips dot-directories.** A buildable entry under `.review/`
  or any other dotted path resolves by a direct `?dir=` query but never appears
  in a scan from the project root, and the Viewer reports that the file does not
  exist. Keep buildable entries out of dotted directories.
- **Verify a Viewer link by loading the page**, not by curling `/__cad/asset`.
  That route serves raw files; a generated entry's render package is served by a
  different route, so probing it returns 404 whether or not anything is wrong.

## Git And LFS

CAD exchange files, generated render/topology assets, and `assets/**` may be
LFS-tracked. Never disable LFS filters for `git add`, commits, or other
object-writing operations. Local hooks live in `.githooks` and
delegate build checks through `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`.
