# Build cadgen's non-Python runtime INTO THE PACKAGE (packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime).
#
# cadgen executes three things it does not write in Python: Node builders (the DXF mesh
# and the mesh exports are baked by a JS child), a headless browser bundle (the snapshot
# CLI drives it in a page), and the CAD Viewer's built client (`cadgen viewer` serves
# it). cadgen.assets resolves all three inside the distribution, so there is one copy
# and one builder of that copy: this script. scripts/bundle/bundle.sh is the entry point
# that calls it (after stamping derived version metadata); call this directly only when
# debugging one stage.
#
# Stages (default: all of them):
#   --node      esbuilt builders          -> _runtime/node       (committed)
#   --browser   snapshot browser bundle   -> _runtime/browser    (committed)
#   --viewer    CAD Viewer client (vite)  -> _runtime/viewer     (gitignored; wheel-only)
#
# The viewer stage is the odd one out: its output is NOT committed. A checkout serves
# apps/viewer/dist directly (cadgen.assets prefers it), so the only consumer of
# _runtime/viewer is `python -m build`, and a 2.7 MB tree that changes on every client
# edit is noise in git. `--check` therefore skips it (nothing committed to diff against)
# and `--print-outputs` does not list it (the release's staged-outputs assertion is about
# what the publish COMMIT must carry). scripts/release/check-wheel-contents.sh is the gate
# that proves the wheel got it.

Usage:
  scripts/bundle/cadgen-runtime.sh [--check] [--clean] [--print-outputs] [stages...]

Builds cadgen's packaged runtime assets into packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime.

Stages (default: all):
  --node      esbuilt Node builders     -> _runtime/node      (committed)
  --browser   snapshot browser bundle   -> _runtime/browser   (committed)
  --viewer    CAD Viewer client (vite)  -> _runtime/viewer    (gitignored; wheel-only)

Options:
  --check          Rebuild into tmp/ and fail if the committed outputs are stale.
                   The viewer stage is skipped: nothing of it is committed.
  --clean          Remove the temporary check/build directories first.
  --print-outputs  Print committed output paths (repo-relative), then exit.
  -h, --help       Show this help.
