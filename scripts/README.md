# Scripts

Durable repo commands, one folder per concern. Every file here is called by a
GitHub Actions workflow, the pre-commit hook, a test, or a documented developer
step; nothing else belongs here (one-off helpers go in `tmp/`).

| Task | Command |
| ---- | ------- |
| Build the packaged runtime | `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --clean` |
| Check the packaged runtime is fresh | `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check` |
| Check the packaged runtime from Windows through WSL 2 | `scripts/dev/build-in-wsl.ps1` |
| Run code tests | `scripts/test/test.sh` |
| Run docs checks | `scripts/test/test-docs.sh` |
| Check the release version and skill pins | `scripts/release/check-version.sh` |
| Stamp every skill's `cadgen==` pin from `VERSION` | `scripts/release/pin-cadgen-requirements.sh` |
| Check the shipping contract | `scripts/github-workflows/check-builds.sh` |
| Install local skills into agents | `scripts/install/install-skills.sh --agent codex` |
| Uninstall local skill links | `scripts/install/uninstall-skills.sh --agent codex` |

## Index

`bundle/` — cadgen's packaged runtime (`packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_runtime`).

- `bundle.sh` — the one entry point: stamps derived version metadata
  (`release/sync-version.mjs`), then runs `cadgen-runtime.sh`. `--check` builds
  into `tmp/` and fails if the committed outputs are stale. Called by `test.yml`,
  `release-publish.yml`, `check-builds.sh`, the pre-commit hook.
- `cadgen-runtime.sh` — builds the three runtime stages: `--node` (esbuilt Node
  builders, committed), `--browser` (snapshot browser bundle, committed),
  `--viewer` (vite build of `apps/viewer`, gitignored, wheel-only). `--print-outputs`
  lists the committed paths. Called by `bundle.sh`, `check-builds.sh`,
  `test/test-installed.sh`; pinned by `tests/python/global/test_node_builder_bundles.py`
  and `test_js_runtime_reproducibility.py`. Call it directly only to debug one stage.
- `lib/node_builders.sh`, `lib/snapshot_runtime.sh` — sourced by
  `cadgen-runtime.sh`; esbuild the Node builders and the browser bundle with
  `three`/`meshoptimizer` pinned from `packages/cadgen-js/package-lock.json`.

`test/` — test runners.

- `test.sh` — `test-js.sh`, then `test-python.sh`, then `test-global.sh`. Called
  by `test.yml` and `release-publish.yml`.
- `test-js.sh` — `packages/cadgen-js` and `apps/viewer` client suites.
- `test-python.sh [--keep-going]` — the cadgen package suite, then every skill's
  suite. Each test FILE runs in its own interpreter against its own temporary
  store, `CADGEN_TEST_JOBS` at a time (default: the core count; CI sets 4).
  `--keep-going` runs all suites and reports every failure.
- `time-python.sh [N]` — times every Python test module on its own and prints
  them sorted by wall clock (results under `tmp/timing/`); `time_module.py` is
  its helper. Manual only: the first step of a bloat check.
- `test-global.sh` — `tests/python/global`, the repo-wide policy suite.
- `test-docs.sh` — `npm --prefix apps/docs run check`, pulling the hero assets
  first. Called by `test.yml` and `release-publish.yml`.
- `test-installed.sh` — builds the wheel, installs it into a scratch venv and
  exercises cadgen from outside the repo. Called by `test.yml` and
  `release-publish.yml`.
- `test-viewer-launch.sh` — launches `cadgen viewer` against the built client and
  checks it answers. Called by `test.yml`.
- `common.sh`, `unittest_files.py` — shared runner pieces (interpreter
  resolution, fail-closed unittest loading, the per-file parallel run). Sourced
  by the runners.

`release/` — the version and the release identity.

- `check-version.sh [--incremented-from REF]` — `VERSION` is valid semver, every
  skill pins `cadgen==VERSION`, and (with the flag) `VERSION` is greater than the
  one at `REF`. Called by `test.yml`, `release-prepare.yml`, `release-publish.yml`,
  `publish-github-release.sh`.
- `bump-version.sh major|minor|patch | --set-version X.Y.Z [--dry-run]` — writes
  `VERSION`; `--check-incremented-from REF` compares against a ref. Called by
  `release-prepare.yml` and `check-version.sh`.
- `pin-cadgen-requirements.sh [--check]` — stamps `cadgen==VERSION` into every
  skill's `requirements.txt`. Called by `release-prepare.yml`; tested by
  `tests/python/global/test_pin_cadgen_requirements.py`.
- `sync-version.mjs [--check]` — stamps the derived versions (package, plugin,
  lockfile and `pyproject.toml` metadata) from `VERSION`. Called by `bundle.sh`,
  `test.yml`, `release-prepare.yml`.
- `check-wheel-contents.sh` — builds the wheel and asserts the Python modules and
  `_runtime/{node,browser,viewer}` are inside it. Called by `test.yml` and
  `release-publish.yml`.
- `publish-github-release.sh [--target REF] [--dry-run] [--publish]` — creates and
  pushes the `v<VERSION>` tag and the GitHub Release (a draft unless
  `--publish`). Called by `release-publish.yml`; a local run on the merged release
  commit is the manual fallback.
- `release-tags.sh` — sourced helpers for tag spelling (`v0.5.0`, and the bare
  `0.4.x` releases before 0.5.0). Sourced by `bump-version.sh`,
  `publish-github-release.sh`, `release-prepare.yml`, `release-publish.yml`.

`github-workflows/` — scripts a workflow runs whole.

- `check-builds.sh [--skip-bundle-check]` — the shipping contract: every path
  `cadgen-runtime.sh --print-outputs` names exists and holds no symlink, no
  tracked symlink anywhere, no LFS path under `skills/`, no skill reaching into a
  repo root; then `bundle.sh --check` unless the workflow already bundled. Called
  by `test.yml`, `release-publish.yml`, the pre-commit hook path. The no-symlink
  rule is load-bearing: Codex `plugin add` drops symlinks silently.
- `deploy-vercel-app.sh` — deploys one Vercel project to production and verifies
  its public URLs. Called by `deploy-docs.yml` only.

`install/` — local development links.

- `install-skills.sh`, `uninstall-skills.sh` — symlink `skills/*` into an agent's
  skill directory (`--agent codex|claude|...`, `--all`, `--dry-run`). Developer
  step in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

`git-hooks/pre-commit` — the body `.githooks/pre-commit` runs: `bundle.sh --check`
when staged paths touch `packages`, `apps`, `skills` or `scripts/bundle`.

`dev/build-in-wsl.ps1` and `dev/wsl-build.sh` — Windows-facing launcher and
Linux driver for reproducing the canonical bundle check in an isolated
WSL-native mirror. The default is a freshness check; neither command publishes,
promotes, installs, or copies generated output into the Windows checkout.

`utils/list-skills.sh` — prints every `skills/*/SKILL.md` directory. Used by the
install scripts and `test-python.sh`.

## CI

| Workflow | Branches/events | Purpose |
| -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `test.yml` | pushes to `main`; PRs to `main`; manual dispatch | Checks `VERSION`, derived metadata and the skill pins as a separate job so the test job still runs if release metadata is wrong. The test job checks generated outputs against their sources, bundles production outputs, checks the layout without rebuilding it, and runs docs and code tests against the generated output. Superseded PR runs are cancelled. |
| `release-prepare.yml` (`Prepare Release`) | manual dispatch | The version bump as a PR: bumps `VERSION`, stamps metadata and skill pins, opens `release/X.Y.Z` against `target` (default `main`; `build-test` rehearses) and merges it. The merge never publishes. |
| `release-publish.yml` (`Publish Release`) | manual dispatch only | Gate (VERSION past the latest tag, or untagged), bundle, tests, wheel build, install test, distribution artifact. The default `publish=false` is a rehearsal; only `main` with explicitly authorized `publish=true` may upload to PyPI, deploy docs, create `v<VERSION>`, and publish a GitHub Release. |
| `deploy-docs.yml` (`Deploy Docs`) | manual dispatch; called by `release-publish.yml` | Deploys the docs app to Vercel production from a ref (default `main`): configures Vercel Authentication for preview deployments only, runs `vercel pull/build/deploy --prod`, and verifies the public production URLs. |

In short: `Prepare Release` bumps, `Publish Release` ships, `Deploy Docs`
redeploys. `main` is the one branch: the source, what installers clone, and what
releases tag; `build-test` is the rehearsal. The CAD Viewer is a local-filesystem
app with no hosted deployment.
